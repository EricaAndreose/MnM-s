				<h2 class="title-2">Introduction</h2>
				<p><span class="myFirstletter">M</span>usic forms an essential and integral part of many funeral rituals around the world 
				(e.g., Bruin-Mollenhorst & Hoondert, 2018; Caswell, 2012; Emke, 2002; Gammon, 1988; 
				Garrido & Garrido, 2016; Kölbl, 2021; Mills, 2012; Parsons, 2012; Prelovšek, 2021). 
				Despite its importance before, during, and after these farewell rituals (e.g. Bruin-Mollenhorst, 2020; 
				Caswell, 2012; Merrill et al., 2022; Viper et al., 2022), <span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">funeral music</span> itself has received little 
				systematic research attention. This is surprising, given music’s key role during the ceremony 
				(Bruin-Mollenhorst, 2020), in the experience of consolation (Hanser et al., 2016; Viper et al., 2022), 
				and during the grieving process (Merrill et al., 2022). The present study aimed to replicate recent findings 
				on <span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">funeral music</span> used in <span class="place" id="NL">the Netherlands</span>, which is characterized as lower in valence, 
				energy, danceability, tempo, higher in acousticness, and more often in a major mode, compared to popular 
				songs in general (Hanser et al., 2022; Mollenhorst et al., 2016). In addition, we investigate whether 
				a similar pattern can be found for <span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">funeral music</span> applied in <span class="place" id="HR">Croatia</span> and 
				<span class="place" id="UK">the United Kingdom</span> and whether there are differences between these countries for the 
				aforementioned values.</p>

				<h2 class="title-3">The Changing Nature of Funerals and <span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">Funeral Music</span></h2>
				<p><span class="myFirstletter">O</span>ver time, funeral rituals are subject to change. In addition, the functions, types, and repertoires of 
				<span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">funeral music</span>, which heavily depend on the region and culture one belongs to, evolve alongside it (Davidson & Garrido, 
				2016; Emke, 2002; Garrido & Davidson, 2016a; Garrido & Garrido, 2016). Historically, funeral rites and <span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">funeral music</span> in 
				(Western) European countries were strongly influenced by Christian traditions (e.g., Bruin-Mollenhorst & Hoondert, 2018; 
				Caswell, 2012; Davidson & Garrido, 2016; Gammon, 1988; Parsons, 2012). <span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">Funeral music</span> mainly consisted of songs, for example, 
				specific hymns and regional variations of the lament <a class="noteRef" href="#n01">1</a> (Gammon, 1988; Kölbl, 2021; Prelovšek, 2021), sometimes accompanied by 
				instruments, but at other times a cappella. This and the number of songs sung at a funeral depended on what religion one belonged 
				to (Caswell, 2012; Garrido & Davidson, 2016a).</p>
				
				<p><span class="myFirstletter">T</span>he introduction of cremations at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries in <span class="place" id="UK">the United Kingdom</span> 
				and <span class="place" id="NL">the Netherlands</span>, respectively, substantially affected the choice and use of <span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">funeral music</span> 
				(Bruin-Mollenhorst & Hoondert, 2018; Parsons, 2012). Nowadays, cremations are the most common type of funeral in these countries 
				(Bruin-Mollenhorst & Hoondert, 2018; Parsons, 2012; Van der Smissen et al., 2019). Within the British and Dutch crematorium setting, 
				recorded music became the standard due to its low costs, and the increased secularization gave way to a more diverse and popular repertoire, 
				while classical and religious music remained the norm until well into the 1970s (Bruin-Mollenhorst & Hoondert, 2018; Parsons, 2012). Initially, 
				the choice of music was also limited due to technological restrictions. C rematoriums in <span class="place" id="NL">the Netherlands</span>, 
				for example, offered standard sets of typically three songs on tape that might be played during short, formal services (Bruin- Mollenhorst & 
				Hoondert, 2018; Van der Smissen et al., 2019). With the development of smaller and more user-friendly sound systems and, more recently, easier 
				(digital) access, the choice of music during a funeral has become almost limitless (see Bruin-Mollenhorst & Hoondert, 2018, also for some additional 
				changes that affected limitations in selection). This fits in with a global shift towards more personalized funeral rituals that, instead of abiding 
				by religious traditions, better fit the wishes of both the deceased and/or bereaved (e.g., Bruin-Mollenhorst & Hoondert, 2018; Caswell, 2011; Emke, 2002; 
				Parsons, 2012).</p>
				
				<p><span class="myFirstletter">I</span>n contrast, the first Croatian crematorium (<span class="place" id="Zagreb">Zagreb</span>) was opened in the 1980s, and a second one was opened in 2021 (<span class="place" id="Osijek">Osijek</span>). 
				Because of this, it can be asserted that cremations in <span class="place" id="HR">Croatia</span> are gaining in frequency, but are still less common than in <span class="place" id="NL">the 
				Netherlands</span> and <span class="place" id="UK">the United Kingdom</span> which may also be reflected in the choice of music. The focus on personalization, and thus also the 
				selection of music, however, also occurs in communities where cremations are less frequent (Emke, 2002). This increase in personalization can be viewed in 
				light of a re-ritualisation of mourning in which 'the life of the deceased is celebrated’ after a period of secularization and less focus on religious traditions 
				(e.g., Caswell, 2011, 2012; Emke, 2002; Garrido & Garrido, 2016; Parsons, 2012; Venbrux et al., 2009; also see Davidson & Garrido, 2016). Additionally, professionals who run funeral 
				homes have become more attentive to both the personal needs and the psychological well-being of the bereaved than to conforming to tradition (Emke, 2002).</p>

				<h2 class="title-3">Functions of <span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">Funeral Music</span></h2>
				<p><span class="myFirstletter">M</span>usic can fulfill various functions during a funeral. These purposes are related
				to the ceremony, such as (1) background music playing while entering or leaving the
				ceremony room and (2) music in between speeches that empowers their contents or
				serves as an illustration of what is said, or music that is more focused on the deceased
				and bereaved, such as (3) the most liked music of the deceased as an expression of
				his or her identity, and (4) evoking and the control of emotions (Bruin-Mollenhorst,
				2020). A piece of music can simultaneously serve various functions during the
				ceremony. These funeral-specific purposes align with the primary psychological
				functions of music listening as identified by Schäfer and colleagues (2013), namely
				music (1) as self-awareness and as an expression of one’s identity, (2) to regulate
				emotion and mood, and (3) to bolster or express social relatedness. Since most music
				heard at Dutch funerals reflects some aspect of the individual who passed away,
				Bruin-Mollenhorst (2020) introduced the concept of the musical eulogy. By listening
				to music that is the departed’s favorite or reflects aspects of their personality,
				memory, or a specific relationship with the bereaved, those present at a funeral pay
				their respects to the deceased. These authors further argued that since most songs are
				not written explicitly with the departed in mind, for the musical eulogy, the lyrics
				and their content matter less than the complete piece of music. It may be just some
				specific sentences, words, the title, or nothing of the lyrics at all, but the music as a whole that relates to the deceased’s identity.</p>
				
				<p><span class="myFirstletter">T</span>he function of <span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">funeral music</span> and its selection process extends beyond the
				funeral ceremony. Music is, for instance, one of the primary sources of consolation
				after losing a loved one (Hanser et al., 2016). Recent qualitative research further
				suggests that the process of music selection by the dying and their next of kin can be
				experienced as consoling both before and, in the case of the bereaved, after the
				funeral (Viper et al., 2022). Music is a way for the bereaved to evoke personal
				memories of and experience a feeling of staying connected with the deceased (Merrill
				et al., 2022; Viper et al., 2022). This connection is considered a continuing bond and
				may aid the bereaved in their grieving process (Klass et al., 2014; Merrill et al.,
				2022).</p>

				<h2 class="title-3"><span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">Funeral Music</span> Characteristics</h2>
				<p><span class="myFirstletter">T</span>he choice of music matters since it is essential to reflect the departed accurately
				(Bruin-Mollenhorst, 2020). However, there was, until recently, little systematic
				research on the possible distinctive features of <span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">funeral music</span>. Traditionally, virtually
				all funeral hymns were in a minor mode, thus sounding sad (Gammon, 1988). Yet,
				as previously outlined, much of the current <span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">funeral music</span> in both the <span class="place" id="UK">United Kingdom</span> and the <span class="place" id="NL">Netherlands</span> is <span class="keyword" id="popularMusic">popular music</span> (Bruin-Mollenhorst, 2019; Caswell,
				2012; Garrido & Davidson, 2016a; Parsons, 2012). However, classical and religious
				music are still popular funeral choices in the highly secularized <span class="place" id="NL">Netherlands</span> (Bruin-
				Mollenhorst, 2019). Australian survey data further suggests that people are inclined
				to choose positive-sounding music for their own funerals. This choice for happy over
				sad-sounding music is at least partially dependent on personality characteristics and
				age (Garrido & Davidson, 2016b). Despite more personal choices regarding music
				being made, some pieces of music remain popular as <span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">funeral music</span> in general. This
				is probably the result of culture and tradition, the aforementioned personal factors, or aspects of the music and lyrics that make it particularly suitable for this purpose
				(Bruin-Mollenhorst, 2019).</p>
				
				<p><span class="myFirstletter">T</span>o investigate the properties of currently used <span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">funeral music</span>, Mollenhorst and
				colleagues (2016) compared the playlist of a Dutch crematorium (including religious
				and classical music) to lists of <span class="keyword" id="popularMusic">popular music</span> (Top 2000, Top 40) in the <span class="place" id="NL">Netherlands</span>
				on valence, energy, tempo, and mode <a class="noteRef" href="#n02">2</a>. These investigators found that <span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">funeral music</span>
				was lower in valence, energy, and tempo and more often in a major mode than music from popular charts and characterized it as sounding solemn, serene, and tender.
				These findings were partially replicated and expanded upon by Hanser et al. (2022),
				who reported that English and Dutch popular funeral songs are lower on <span class="keyword" id="spotify">Spotify</span>
				values of valence, energy, and danceability but higher in acousticness than non-
				<span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">funeral music</span>. <span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">Funeral music</span> was also more often in a major mode. No significant
				differences in tempo were found.</p>
				
				<p><span class="myFirstletter">L</span>isteners who are in a sad mood tend to prefer music that matches their
				disposition (Hunter et al., 2011), and (self-selected) sad music may, for example,
				help the person to cope and acknowledge their feelings of sadness and loss, and to
				experience consolation (e.g., Eerola et al., 2018; Hanser et al., 2016; Taruffi &
				Koelsch, 2014; Van den Tol & Edwards, 2013; Van den Tol, 2016). A major mode
				and fast tempo are often associated with happiness, while a minor mode and slow
				tempo are commonly related to sadness (e.g., Juslin & Laukka, 2004; Schellenberg
				& Von Scheve, 2012). Most <span class="keyword" id="popularMusic">popular music</span> is in a major mode; however, as this broad
				genre evolved during the second half of the 20th century, its tempo decreased, and
				more songs were written in a minor mode. This decrease in tempo was largest for
				songs in a major mode. Overall, <span class="keyword" id="popularMusic">popular music</span> became more sad sounding
				(Schellenberg & Von Scheve, 2012), with musical cues such as tempo and mode
				giving mixed messages, resulting in a more complex, mixed affect (e.g.,
				Swaminathan & Schellenberg, 2015). A slow tempo in combination with a major
				mode is often associated with music sounding tender (Juslin & Laukka, 2004). Music
				characteristics of <span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">funeral music</span> thus suggest it sounds sad and tender, and is of mixed
				affect (Hanser et al., 2022; Mollenhorst et al., 2016).</p>
				
				<p><span class="myFirstletter">T</span>he question remains whether these findings on the characteristics of funeral
				music are specific to the <span class="place" id="NL">Netherlands</span> or apply in other countries. As said, the
				selection process of <span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">funeral music</span> is highly personal but also depends, at least to
				some extent, on culture and tradition. <span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">Funeral music</span> may include local songs and
				theme music from popular television shows (Caswell, 2012) and may thus vary
				considerably between countries. Studies that explore potential cultural differences in
				the audio characteristics of music used for a specific purpose are still scarce, even
				though there is reason to assume such differences exist. Recent investigations on
				music streaming data reveal cultural differences in arousal levels of streamed music
				(Park et al., 2019), but a relationship with specific listening behavior or function,
				such as for a funeral, was not considered. Differences, however, also appear in
				listening to music for mood regulation. For example, the down-regulation of anger
				in East Asian cultures seems to be associated with energetic music (Liew et al.,
				2022). To the best of our knowledge, a cross-cultural <span class="keyword" id="comparison">comparison</span> (here limited to
				several European countries) of <span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">funeral music</span> characteristics is currently missing. The
				present study considers <span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">funeral music</span> used in <span class="place" id="HR">Croatia</span>, the <span class="place" id="NL">Netherlands</span>, and the
				<span class="place" id="UK">United Kingdom</span>. These countries were selected because of the dates of crematorium
				appearances and the availability of lists of music used at funerals. Previous investigations into <span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">funeral music</span> used in the <span class="place" id="NL">Netherlands</span> served as a starting point
				(Hanser et al., 2022; Mollenhorst et al., 2016).</p>

				<h2 class="title-3">The Current Study</h2>
				<p><span class="myFirstletter">T</span>he present study consists of two parts. First, the <span class="keyword" id="spotify">Spotify</span> audio features of
				valence, energy, danceability, instrumentalness, acousticness, tempo, and mode of
				<span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">funeral music</span> from <span class="place" id="HR">Croatia</span> (HR), the <span class="place" id="NL">Netherlands</span> (NL), and the <span class="place" id="UK">United Kingdom</span>
				(UK) are individually compared to values of general popular chart music from the
				same nation. We expect findings for all countries to reflect those reported earlier in
				<span class="place" id="NL">Netherlands</span>: <span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">funeral music</span> is lower in valence, energy, danceability, and tempo, higher in
				acousticness and instrumentalness, and more often in a major mode than popular
				music in general.</p>
				
				<p><span class="myFirstletter">S</span>econd, the aforementioned <span class="keyword" id="spotify">Spotify</span> values for <span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">funeral music</span> from <span class="place" id="HR">Croatia</span>, <span class="place" id="NL">Netherlands</span>, and
				<span class="place" id="UK">UK</span> are compared between countries. Differences may be present due to, for
				example, variations in funeral traditions or country-specific choices, but since this
				analysis is exploratory, we did not formulate specific hypotheses for this research
				goal. Yet, due to its geographical proximity, it is plausible that potential differences
				between <span class="place" id="NL">Netherlands</span> and <span class="place" id="UK">UK</span> are more minor than those between the <span class="place" id="NL">Netherlands</span>/<span class="place" id="UK">UK</span> and <span class="place" id="HR">Croatia</span>.</p>

				<h2 class="title-2">Method</h2>
				<h2 class="title-3">Materials</h2>
				<h2 class="title-3"><i>Song Selection: <span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">Funeral Music</span></i></h2>
				<p><span class="myFirstletter">T</span>he selection process was like that of previous research on <span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">funeral music</span> in
				which online sources were consulted (Hanser et al., 2022; Mollenhorst et al., 2016).
				For a sufficiently large sample of music, information was gathered from multiple
				websites belonging to funeral homes, crematoria, funeral insurers, musicians, or
				other funeral-related services that offer help, lists of (often) used music, or examples
				of what music to use at a funeral. This resulted in selections of N = 388 Croatian
				(<span class="place" id="HR">Croatia</span>), N = 500 Dutch (<span class="place" id="NL">Netherlands</span>), and N = 439 <span class="place" id="UK">United Kingdom</span> (UK) pieces of, in the
				specific country, popular <span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">funeral music</span>. These websites were accessed, and <span class="keyword" id="spotify">Spotify</span>
				values were downloaded in October and November 2022, and February 2023. <span class="place" id="NL">Netherlands</span>
				and <span class="place" id="UK">UK</span> websites provide lists of recorded music. Table 1 provides an overview of
				the consulted sources and <span class="keyword" id="spotify">Spotify</span> playlists.</p>
				
				<p><span class="myFirstletter">L</span>ive music is the norm in <span class="place" id="HR">Croatia</span>, although the use of recorded music is
				increasing, for instance, because of restrictions on live performances during the
				Covid-19 pandemic (Perinić Lewis et al., 2022). HR websites thus typically offer a
				repertoire of live music to be played at the funeral instead of the playback of pre-
				recorded music. The general idea behind these lists, whether pre-recorded or live, is
				the same: they serve as inspiration for the bereaved when they have to select the most
				appropriate music for a specific funeral.</p>

				<p><span class="myFirstletter">W</span>ithin the selection of each country, duplicate music was avoided. For example, we only included one version of Gounod’s Ave Maria, 
				even though several versions were listed. Unless a specific version of classical or religious music was mentioned, 
				we used the first suggested entry by the <span class="keyword" id="spotify">Spotify</span> search. Each country had some songs listed that we could not find on 
				<span class="keyword" id="spotify">Spotify</span> (<span class="place" id="HR">HR</span> N = 19 (5%), <span class="place" id="NL">NL</span> N = 22 (4%),

				For the <span class="place" id="UK">UK</span>, according to Officielcharts.com, we used number 1

				(R Core Team, 2022; Thompson et al., 2021). Information was gathered for all individual pieces of music on a track’s 
				acousticness (how acoustic a track sounds); danceability (a composite score that takes into account rhythm, beat, 
				and regularity to provide an estimate on how danceable a track is); energy (a perceptual measure on a track's arousal and intensity); 
				instrumentalness (predicts whether a track is instrumental or contains vocals); mode (whether a track is in a major (1) or minor (0) mode), 
				tempo (an estimate of the beats per minute; BPM), and lastly; valence (a perceptual measure on how positive a track sounds. 
				Lower values point towards more negatively sounding music). Apart from mode, higher values indicate an increase 
				in a specific feature. These audio features, or music characteristics, have been used before with <span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">funeral music</span> 
				(Hanser et al., 2022). Additionally, these measures have been used to characterize dance music (Duman et al., 2022), 
				music that promotes sleep (Scarratt et al., 2023), music that is used in pain management (Howlin & Rooney, 2021); 
				and to investigate mood-regulation through music (Liew et al., 2022; Vidas et al., 2021).</p>
				
				<h2 class="title-3">Statistical Analyses</h2>
				<p><span class="myFirstletter">A</span>nalyses were conducted with IBM SPSS 28.0 and R 4.1.1. Analyses consisted of non-parametric tests, 
				due to violations of normality (Shapiro-Wilk test, all ps < .05 for all variables), and unequal selection sizes. 
				Potential differences between the funeral and <span class="keyword" id="popularMusic">popular music</span> within each country were investigated through a series of 
				independent sample Welch’s t-tests on each of <span class="keyword" id="spotify">Spotify</span>’s audio characteristics. We report the effect size of the t-tests as 
				Cohen’s d (small 0.2, medium 0.5, and large 0.8; Cohen, 1988). Findings are considered significant at p = .008 (.05/6) due to multiple 
				<span class="keyword" id="comparison">comparisons</span>. The categorical value of mode was investigated through a Chi square test, and its effect size φ 
				(small .1, medium .3, and large .5; Cohen, 1988) is reported.</p>
				<p>Subsequently, Kruskal-Wallis tests were conducted to compare <span class="keyword" id="spotify">Spotify</span> audio features between countries. 
				Statistical differences were further explored with pairwise <span class="keyword" id="comparison">comparisons</span>. The effect size is reported as ε² 
				(small .01, medium .06, and large .14; Tomczak & Tomczak, 2014). Because of multiple-<span class="keyword" id="comparison">comparison</span> post-hoc testing, conservative Bonferroni 
				corrections were applied.</p>
				
				<h2 class="title-2">Results</h2>
				<h2 class="title-3">Music Characteristics</h2>
				<p><span class="myFirstletter">F</span>irst, differences between the audio characteristics of funeral and <span class="keyword" id="popularMusic">popular music</span> were explored separately for each country (see Table 2). 
				In <span class="place" id="HR">Croatia</span>, <span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">funeral music</span> was significantly lower in danceability, energy, and 
				valence but higher in acousticness than <span class="keyword" id="popularMusic">popular music</span>. After correcting for multiple testing, there was no significant difference 
				in instrumentalness or tempo. Effect sizes were medium (danceability and acousticness) to large (energy and valence). Both funeral and
				popular control songs were more often in a major mode, but <span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">funeral music</span> was
				significantly more often in a major mode than control music χ2 = 6.16, p = .013 with

				<h2 class="title-2">Discussion</h2>
				<p><span class="myFirstletter">R</span>ecent investigations into <span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">funeral music</span> used in the <span class="place" id="NL">Netherlands</span> (Hanser et al.,
				2022; Mollenhorst et al., 2016) showed that it is lower in valence, energy, and tempo
				but higher in acousticness compared to <span class="keyword" id="popularMusic">popular music</span> in general. <span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">Funeral music</span> is
				also more often in a major mode. The present study analyzed <span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">funeral music</span> used in
				<span class="place" id="HR">Croatia</span>, the <span class="place" id="NL">Netherlands</span>, and the <span class="place" id="UK">United Kingdom</span> based on the following music
				characteristics: valence, energy, danceability, acousticness, instrumentalness, tempo,
				and mode as obtained from the music streaming platform <span class="keyword" id="spotify">Spotify</span>.</p>
				
				<p><span class="myFirstletter">O</span>ur first hypothesis was that comparing <span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">funeral music</span> from <span class="place" id="HR">Croatia</span> and the
				<span class="place" id="UK">United Kingdom</span> to <span class="keyword" id="popularMusic">popular music</span> from these countries would reveal a similar
				pattern. The present results confirm this expectation. Additionally, previous findings
				on the difference between funeral and <span class="keyword" id="popularMusic">popular music</span> in the <span class="place" id="NL">Netherlands</span> were
				replicated (Hanser et al., 2022; Mollenhorst et al., 2016). Moreover, effect sizes of
				these differences were substantial. The only exceptions to this pattern are
				instrumentalness and tempo (although trends are visible), which showed no
				significant difference between funeral and control music in <span class="place" id="HR">Croatia</span>. This is likely due
				to the live repertoire in this country, as opposed to the selection of recorded music in
				the <span class="place" id="NL">Netherlands</span> and the <span class="place" id="UK">United Kingdom</span> which also included large orchestral works.</p>
				
				<p><span class="myFirstletter">T</span>he second analysis addressed possible between-country differences. Given the
				exploratory nature of this research question, we did not formulate a specific
				hypothesis, but we nevertheless anticipated minimal differences between the
				<span class="place" id="NL">Netherlands</span> and the <span class="place" id="UK">United Kingdom</span>. This was indeed the case. Moreover, although
				we found significant differences for the characteristics of energy, acousticness,
				instrumentalness, and valence between Croatian <span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">funeral music</span> and that of the
				<span class="place" id="NL">Netherlands</span> and the <span class="place" id="UK">United Kingdom</span>, these differences were minimal at best. These
				discrepancies are likely due to the lack of (predominantly) instrumental <a class="noteRef" href="#n03">3</a> pieces of
				music in the Croatian selection.</p>
				
				<p><span class="myFirstletter">M</span>oreover, we analyzed fewer pieces of <span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">funeral music</span> used in <span class="place" id="HR">Croatia</span>, which
				may also have contributed to these minor differences. The analysis of fewer songs,
				for example, also underlies the lack of difference in tempo between funeral and
				control music reported by Hanser et al. (2022) since the tempo of <span class="keyword" id="popularMusic">popular music</span>
				averages out to 120 BPM (see Duman et al., 2022 for a discussion). Yet, the present
				variations should also not be overstated. The pattern of differences in values between
				Croatian funeral and <span class="keyword" id="popularMusic">popular music</span> is quite similar to that of the two other countries
				in the present work, and values for both the funeral and popular selection correspond
				to what one might expect from previous studies (see Hanser et al., 2022; Mollenhorst
				et al., 2016).</p>
				
				<p><span class="myFirstletter">T</span>he present findings suggest that the characterization of <span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">funeral music</span> in <span class="place" id="NL">Netherlands</span> as
				sounding solemn, serene, and tender (Mollenhorst et al., 2016) extends to music used
				for this purpose in <span class="place" id="HR">Croatia</span> and the <span class="place" id="UK">United Kingdom</span>. Despite the sometimes very
				different tunes that range from theme songs from television or sports, music sung in
				Dutch or Croatian, and other culturally specific choices, <span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">funeral music</span> within and
				between these countries appears to be more alike than dissimilar, at least when it
				comes to the investigated music characteristics. Additionally, all three countries are
				relatively close to one another and have been influenced by Christian traditions. This
				strong resemblance results in, for example, the presence of local versions of the hymn
				Amazing Grace (NL Waarheen, Waarvoor, HR Milost) in all three samples.
				Likewise, multiple compositions of Ave Maria were used. Research into the
				perception of (discrete and dimensional) emotions in film music between Finnish and
				Spanish also showed few and slight differences between these countries (Fuentes-
				Sánchez et al., 2021). Differences in the role of, for example, energy and arousal
				were found between cultures, but these were reported between East Asian, Latin
				American, and Western cultures (e.g., Liew et al., 2022; Park et al., 2019). In the
				present study, these variations may be absent or small at best between the
				geographically and culturally neighboring European regions.</p>
				
				<p><span class="myFirstletter">A</span>n alternative explanation is that music characteristics other than the ones
				provided by <span class="keyword" id="spotify">Spotify</span> reveal cross-cultural differences. Analyses of what can be
				described as music show that a singular definition of what constitutes music is hard
				to find and that it depends on more factors than valence, tempo, and mode but also
				on, for example, pitch (Savage et al., 2015) or the use of specific instruments (Kölbl,
				2021).</p>
				
				<p><span class="myFirstletter">T</span>he present work did not consider lyrics, even though song texts are particularly
				relevant to sad-sounding and soothing music (e.g., Ali & Peynircioğlu, 2006;
				Brattico et al., 2011; Fiveash & Luck, 2016; Hanser et al., 2016; Van den Tol &
				Edwards, 2013). Hanser and colleagues (2022) found more use of second-person
				pronouns (you, yours) and future-focused words (will, shall) when comparing the
				lyrics of funeral and popular control songs. These authors reported more positive
				(e.g., love, sun, stars) than negative words in <span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">funeral music</span>, but also more words
				expressing sadness. <span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">Funeral music</span> lyrics are thus somewhat emotionally mixed (Swaminathan & Schellenberg, 2015). Second-person pronouns are associated with
				increased popularity and may express a social connection in which listeners think of
				someone important to them (Packard & Berger, 2020). This makes second-person
				pronouns particularly relevant to <span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">funeral music</span>. Together with the future focus, these
				words may help the bereaved express or form continuing bonds with the deceased.
				These combinations (i.e., ‘I will always love you’) may be particularly prevalent in
				the song title or chorus, which by repetition receives much emphasis (Hanser et al.,
				2022). These parts of the text may be especially relevant to the song selection for the
				musical eulogy (Bruin-Mollenhorst, 2020). Replication of these lyrical
				characteristics in English and other languages is needed because it is evident from
				previous work that music characteristics alone do not fully explain why some songs
				are popular as <span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">funeral music</span> and others are not. Moreover, a textual analysis may
				reveal potential differences in thinking about death and mourning, for example,
				between cultures, but also between listeners with different music genre preferences.</p>
				
				<p><span class="myFirstletter">T</span>he increasing personalization of funerals and, thus, <span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">funeral music</span> may lead to
				an increasingly diverse and idiosyncratic repertoire. Yet, some music is still chosen
				more often than others (Bruin-Mollenhorst, 2019). The current findings on how
				audio characteristics correspond to specific emotions and uses may explain part of
				this attraction. Personal choices involve different artists but may also have similar
				audio features. Over time, often-used <span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">funeral music</span> may be replaced by newer, then
				popular songs, but with potentially comparable music characteristics as the present
				repertoire.</p>

				<h2 class="title-3">Limitations</h2>
				<p><span class="myFirstletter">T</span>he present study is marked by several limitations in addition to the ones
				already mentioned. First, although <span class="keyword" id="spotify">Spotify</span> provides basic descriptions of what its
				music audio features mean (<span class="keyword" id="spotify">Spotify</span> for Developers, 2022), how these scores are
				compiled is unclear. Several studies have, however, linked these values to
				characterize music used for a specific behavior, functions, and certain situations, such
				as pain management, funeral rituals, leisure, and mood regulation (Duman et al.,
				2022; Hanser et al., 2022; Howlin & Rooney, 2021; Liew et al., 2022; Mollenhorst
				et al., 2016; Scarratt et al., 2023; Vidas et al., 2021). Still, carefully considering
				<span class="keyword" id="spotify">Spotify</span> values concerning existing databases of, for example, values for music
				valence, or different methods of extracting audio features from a piece of music is
				necessary to investigate their validity.</p>
				
				<p><span class="myFirstletter">S</span>econdly, since these types of music are still commonly used during funeral
				rituals, selections of <span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">funeral music</span> included classical, religious, and folk music, as
				listed on the websites we consulted, to form a more valid representation of the funeral
				music repertoire. These types of music are less likely to appear in the top charts of
				<span class="keyword" id="popularMusic">popular music</span> (even though they may be widely known, see Bruin-Mollenhorst,
				2019), which may account for some differences in, for example, instrumentalness. However, differences in the other audio features, as reported in this study, correspond
				to the pattern found by Hanser and colleagues (2022), who only compared popular
				<span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">funeral music</span> songs to controls. The inclusion of these genres thus seems to be no
				problem. Moreover, the distinction between popular, classical, and religious music
				is sometimes neglectable, consider, for example, Beyoncé’s Ave Maria. Including
				several different compilation records and playlists for Croatian popular control music
				may have introduced some bias, such as the underrepresentation of <span class="keyword" id="popularMusic">popular music</span>
				from the 2010s. Relying on a single or more comparable lists is recommended for
				future study.</p>
				
				<p><span class="myFirstletter">T</span>hirdly, the current study is archival. This means that, other than that the music
				selections are used at funerals or qualify as pop music, we cannot make inferences
				on specific circumstances or situations under which these songs were selected or any
				person’s specific traits or specific objectives (e.g., to comfort the bereaved or to
				honor of characterize the deceased) that may underly the choice for particular funeral
				music. Further qualitative and quantitative investigations should focus on personal
				preference, personality traits, song appropriateness, cultural norms, and further use
				of <span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">funeral music</span> by the bereaved, as well as the involvement of the bereaved in the
				selection process and performance of this music. This may provide us with valuable
				information, given the substantial role of music in mourning and grief processing
				(Merrill et al., 2022).</p>

				<div id="decor3"></div>

				<h2 class="title-2">Conclusion</h2>
				<p><span class="myFirstletter">T</span>he current study reproduced previous findings on the characteristics of Dutch
				<span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">funeral music</span>. It showed that it tends to be lower in valence, energy, and tempo,
				higher in acousticness and instrumentalness, and more often in a major mode than
				<span class="keyword" id="popularMusic">popular music</span> in general. It further demonstrated that most of this pattern also applies
				to <span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">funeral music</span> from the <span class="place" id="UK">United Kingdom</span> and <span class="place" id="HR">Croatia</span> when compared to popular
				music. Moreover, differences between countries were absent or small, and are likely
				due to the applied selection method. Personal and local preferences may be
				responsible for the considerable variation in songs and artists, whereas the underlying
				music characteristics may, to a great extent, be similar. Future work should consider
				this personal choice and relevance in more detail. In addition, comparing these values
				between geographically more distant cultures seems warranted, because of potential
				differences in, for example, the use of music that is higher in energy for emotion
				regulation (see Liew et al., 2022). Further investigations should also address song
				lyrics. The present work and other recent studies that link audio features to specific
				behavior may help us understand why some music is supporting or helpful in
				particular situations, which may lead to potential interventions aimed at well-being.
				Research on <span class="keyword" id="funeralMusic">funeral music</span>, in particular, is needed given music’s importance in the
				grieving process, the formation of continuing bonds, and how to better understand
				and aid people in mourning (Merill et al., 2022; Viper et al., 2022).</p>

				<p class="note" id="n01"><span class="noteMarker">1. </span> It is beyond the scope of this article to provide a full overview of funeral music traditions
					and specific outings, such as the Croatian lament. For more information see, among others,
					Gammon (1988), Katić (2013), Kölbl (2021), Prelovšek (2021) and additional
					ethnomusicological literature referenced in these sources. </p>
				<p class="note" id="n02"><span class="noteMarker">2. </span> Mollenhorst et al. (2016) used Echo Nest to extract these audio features. This is owned by
					Spotify. </p>
				<p class="note" id="n03"><span class="noteMarker">3. </span> For all funeral music (1327 pieces), there are negative correlations between instrumentalness
					(all ps < .001) and the characteristics of danceability (-.34), energy (-.35), valence (-.28), and
					tempo (-.14), and a positive correlation with acousticness (.30), which adds to our explanation
					that fewer instrumental music has led to these differences in values. </p>
