                            <h2>The Magazine</h2>
                            <p> 
                                Music and Maps Magazine is a digital magazine dedicated to music and its various facets. The magazine currently contains three issues, dedicated to three variations on the music theme: music and technology, music and contexts, and music and fashion. For each issue there are three articles related to the theme that have been selected from authoritative online publications and whose authors and all related metadata are given.
                                The issues were thus divided among the three developers of the project:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Erica Andreose: Music and Techonologies</li>
                                    <li>Chiara Parravicini: Music and Context</li>
                                    <li>Gaia Ortona: Music and Fashion</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Music and Maps Magazine allows you to vary the typographic, graphic, and aural appearance of the site as you explore the articles. The style variations are devoted to 6 different historical periods: 1500, 1800, 1930, 1970, 2000, 2030. Each historical period takes specific references and adapts the layout style of the articles to them.
                                The css styles were thus divided among the three developers of the project:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Erica Andreose: 1550 and 2000</li>
                                    <li>Chiara Parravicini: 1800 and 1970</li>
                                    <li>Gaia Ortona: 1930 and 2000</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>     
                            <h2>The Vinyl</h2>          
                            <p>
                                Given the theme chosen for the magazine, we thought of rotating (metaphorically and literally) the pages of our website around the presence of a digital record player that offers different tracks and records for each style. This will allow the user to experience a greater degree of immersion in the reading experience.
                                The vinyl record player consists of:
                                an arm that raises and lowers each time the music player is started or stopped
                                a disc that rotates of 365 degrees with a constant speed 
                                a player that handles music start and play, buttons to navigate back and forth through the song list, and an upper string where song titles are displayed.
                            </p> 
                            <h2>1500 - Books of Hours and the advent of incunabula</h2>  
                            <p>
                                For the 1500 style, I have decided to focus on a precise textual type that sees its greatest rise and demise precisely between the late 15th century and the first part of the 16th, I am talking about the Book of Hours. A devotional text that encompasses prayers and psalms as an abbreviated form of the breviary, containing the canonical Hours recited in monasteries. It also marks the canonical feasts of the saints and the succession of Christian devotional time.
                                With the arrival of printing at the end of the 15th century books there was a great revolution that sparked enormous changes in how books were made and disseminated. Great changes that also affected patrons. Now that getting a book of hours had become easier and cheaper, even the less affluent classes could afford and access prayer books. This is precisely why the elite and wealthy class must make up for the ascendant accessibility of the book of hours with increasingly rare and expensive private commissions. Books of Hours made on commission in the 16th century are in fact luxury texts for private devotion containing illustrations and decorations that reach the highest heights of realism and richness. Nobles demanded the creation of works that would then be passed down through the family as a symbol of unparalleled power and devotion. For miniatures and decorations, simple scribes are no longer hired but real painters and artists who generally work on full-size canvas. 

                                Some examples I have used as visual references of the chosen style are:

                                <ul>
                                    <li><a href="https://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/illuminated/manuscript/discover/book-of-hours/section/panel-intro/folio/folio-96r" target="_blank">Book of hours of Flanders, MS 1058-1975, c.1510-1520</a> (from which I borrowed some floral decorations for the layout of the text area)</li>
                                    <li><a href="http://artscash.com/books-5.html" target="_blank">The Rothschild Prayerbook, Ghent or Bruges, c.1505-1510</a></li>
                                    <li><a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/684184" target="_blank">Floreal Book of Hours,ca. 1530–35</a></li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                            <h3>Typographic style</h3>  
                            <p>
                                The layout I have chosen to follow has narrow margins of 23vh for the left and right lado that force the text into a justified central column, to recall the arrangement of manuscript writing within the illuminated side decorations that in my case recall the rich three-dimensionally illusory illustration with flowers and small animals that appear to be resting on top of a sheet of gold.
                                These images were digitally processed and are the result of a mashup of several images derived from the Book of hours of Flander.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The main font I chose to use is <a href="https://www.dafont.com/1492-quadrata-lim.font" target="_blank">"1492 Square (2008)"</a> created by <a href="http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-48561.html" target="_blank">Gilles Le Corre</a>, a French designer. 
                                This font can be downloaded for free from DaFont and reminded me of the hybrid Gothic bookhand known as bastard, bâtarde or lettre bourguignonne. A style of writing greatly used for luxury manuscripts of that period. Thus, we can say that it is a somewhat "retro" font that wants to maintain the Gothic origins of the manuscript but moves closer and closer to the rigor and breath of the printed setting. These are thus the last glimmers of handwriting before the final abandonment of the copyist's practice. The font, in addition to being extremely precise in the shape of some particular letters such as g, s, and t, also represents well the characteristic of amanuensis writing, in which letters can be extremely strict and neat (so much so that they appear to be printed) but also enclose delightful smudges and spots that recall their human-originated nature.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The line spacing is 2.4rem because it is more reminiscent of that shown in the references, where the text continues by standing very close to the capitals.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For the letterheads I looked for a font that recalled the rich decorated initials of the period. During my search I came across this site that archives images and decorative alphabets and designs from various eras: <a href="https://www.fromoldbooks.org/" target="_blank">https://www.fromoldbooks.org/</a>
                                Searching the archive, there were some <a href="https://www.fromoldbooks.org/DelamotteOrnamentalAlphabets/pages/051-16th-Century/" target="_blank">16th-century alphabets</a> and I found one with ornate initials reminiscent of a future evolution of bastard Gothic (see the letters d, y and q) with decorations inside that recalled medieval bestiaries. I then chose to turn this design into an alphabet using <a href="https://www.calligraphr.com/en/ " target="_blank">Calligraphr</a>'s online portal. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Within the text, through specific divs, other small decorations of flowers or illuminated insects have been inserted that precisely recall the illustrations of the valuable manuscript of the time.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The mouse cursor is replaced by a <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/manicules" target="_blank">manicula</a> reminiscent of the decorations that copyists inserted at the edges of text in manuscripts to signal an oversight or a paragraph to be linked to another. In the 19th century the manicule became a popular typographic symbol. Today, the manicule is a standard typographic symbol intended to draw the reader’s attention to important text.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The vinyl retains its function but changes disc and loads a <a href="https://www.pinterest.it/pin/482800022555498875/" target="_blank">zodiac drawing</a> by <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battista_Agnese" target="_blank">Battista Agnese</a>, a 16th-century Italian cartographer. The zodiac and the scanning of time and the celestial sphere through months and signs is an extremely present feature of the historical period. The wealthy class especially was very much connected to astrology and the study of the position of the stars. This particular detail also recalls the layout of another very famous book of hours, namely the one illustrated by the <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tr%C3%A8s_riches_heures_du_Duc_de_Berry" target="_blank">Limbourg Brothers for the Duc de Berry</a>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The map also changes style to match the reporting period. For this I worked an <a href="https://blog.mapbox.com/designing-the-treasure-map-style-4318390ad81c" target="_blank">existing prototype</a> on MapBox Studio, making changes to match the colors to my palette to align the fonts used and symbols as closely as possible. 
                            </p>
