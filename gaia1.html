<p class="start">It's almost impossible to envision a world where <span class="keyword" id="music">music</span> and <span class="keyword" id="fashion">fashion</span> do not go hand in hand. <span class="keyword" id="music">Music</span> affects our lives greatly and speaks 
volumes to the times we are living in. On August 4th, I attended my first concert post-pandemic, and it was one of the most exhilarating 
and liberating experiences that I've had in years. My teenage daughter and I went to see <span class="person" id="GD">Green Day</span> and <span class="person"id="Weezer">Weezer</span> at the “Hella Mega Tour”, 
sadly <span class="person" id="FOB">Fall Out Boy</span> had to cancel due to one of its members testing positive for Covid. As soon as I walked into the stadium, I noticed 
that the punk movement is alive and well in <span class="place" id="NYC">NYC</span> and <span class="person" id="GD">Green Day</span> fans at every age were rocking their leather jackets, colorful hair, 
corsets and plaid. It was thrilling to see all these teens and adults rocking out and having the best time. So naturally, it inspired 
this post on how <span class="keyword" id="music">music</span> influences <span class="keyword" id="fashion">fashion</span>.</p>
<p>The influence <span class="keyword" id="music">music</span> has on <span class="keyword" id="fashion">fashion</span> has been evident throughout history. <span class="keyword" id="music">Music</span>, much like <span class="keyword" id="fashion">fashion</span>, has always been used as a way of 
self-expression and both are also emotional and obtainable forms of art that the masses can enjoy and partake in. <span class="keyword" id="fashion">Fashion</span>, like <span class="keyword" id="music">music</span>, 
is one of the clearest signs of the times, and it says more about our culture than we give it credit for. We can easily distinguish the 
difference between the bell-bottom jean's hippies wore in 1969 versus the skin-tight denim worn by emo teens in 2005.</p>

<h2 class="title-2">1920'S FLAPPER</h2>

<p>In today's day and age jazz <span class="keyword" id="music">music</span> may seem squeaky clean and innocent, but it was extremely scandalous during its early years because 
it was the first form of <span class="keyword" id="music">music</span> that was played almost exclusively at nightclubs and speakeasies that hosted people of all races. 
Jazz <span class="keyword" id="music">music</span>also tended to have strong feminist undertones, which changed the way women behaved and dressed.</p>

<p>Many women who were fans of jazz <span class="keyword" id="music">music</span> dressed in flapper <span class="keyword" id="fashion">fashion</span>. These feminists broke out of the traditional roles that society had 
placed on them and opted instead for short dresses, no bras, and loose clothing that gave them movement and freedom to dance the night 
away.</p>

<h2 class="title-2">1950'S TEEN POP</h2>
<br>

<p>Despite the impact the Roaring Twenties had on flapper <span class="keyword" id="fashion">fashion</span>, most <span class="keyword" id="fashion">fashion</span> houses ignored teens and only catered to adult tastes. 
Thankfully, this all changed in the 1950s, with advent of  television and movies, and of course, as <span class="keyword" id="music">music</span> became more widely available 
to the public. With the rising visibility of movie stars and rock and roll artists, such as <span class="person" id="EP">Elvis Presley</span>, a new demand began to arise. 
Teenagers craved clothes that bore a resemblance to the <span class="keyword" id="fashion">fashion</span> that their favorite idols wore. The teen market grew to the point that 
designers no longer could ignore it, and so, the teen <span class="keyword" id="fashion">fashion</span> industry was born.</p>
<br> <h2 class="title-2">1960'S MOD</h2>

<p>The '60s were a swinging time in <span class="place" id="London">London</span> as a more modern version of jazz began to evolve and the “modernists” movement was born. This '60s
subculture also embraced the musical styles of ska, R&B, and soul.</p>
<p>The “modernists” embraced the bohemian lifestyle of the '50s Beatnik generation, so it came as no surprise that many chose to mimic 
that look as part of their lifestyle. Eventually, this extremely <span class="keyword" id="fashion">fashion</span>-conscious clique of clubkids became known as Mods.</p>

<p>By the middle of the '60s, the Mod subculture's brand of beatnik-meets-modern <span class="keyword" id="fashion">fashion</span> became one of the biggest trends in high <span class="keyword" id="fashion">fashion</span> 
history. Even today, both the <span class="keyword"id="music">music</span> and the stylistic aesthetic of Mod <span class="keyword" id="fashion">fashion</span> continues to be a joyful and youthful source of inspiration
for top designers.</p>
<br> <h2 class="title-2">1960'S HIPPIES </h2><br>

<p>While <span class="place" id="London">London</span>teens embraced the Mod movement, teens in America had a very different <span class="keyword" id="fashion">fashion</span> revolution. During the Sixties, many American 
teenage boys were being drafted to fight during the Vietnam War, and as a result, musicians began to write <span class="keyword" id="music">music</span> that reflected those 
anti-establishment times.</p>

<p>During this period, many musicians and fans began to experiment with psychedelic drugs like LSD and peyote. As a result, both <span class="keyword" id="music">music</span> and 
<span class="keyword" id="fashion">fashion</span> turned trippy, in the form of tie-dye motifs, bold floral prints, crafty accessories, crochet, fringe, and bell bottom jeans 
among the biggest trends of the time.</p>
<br><h2 class="title-2"> 1970'S PUNK </h2><br>

<p>Much like Mods, many early punks also enjoyed the musical genre of ska, reggae, and soul. However, this <span class="keyword" id="music">music</span> Punk scene quickly became 
known for aggressive rock <span class="keyword" id="music">music</span> with just very light ska elements tossed into the mix.</p>
<p>The punk movement quickly evolved to become a social one. Due to punk <span class="keyword" id="music">music</span>'s deep focus on individuality and freedom, many people 
joined the punk scene as a way to raise their middle finger to the establishment. So their sartorial choices were always been geared 
towards hand made items like leather jackets, brightly colored hair, piercings and anything that looked different from typical 
mainstream.</p>

<p>Punk is generally considered to be the first real <span class="keyword" id="music">music</span>subculture out there, with Glam Rock being a close second.</p>
<br> <h2 class="title-2">1970'S GLAM ROCK </h2><br>

<p>As special effects during the Seventies were being used in television and films, and Star Wars became one of the first movies to involve 
so many of these effects, it made sense for musicians to sign on. The '70s were one of the first decades that truly embraced science 
fiction as it became a major focal point in pop culture.</p>
<p>Musicians such as <span class="person" id="DV">David Bowie</span>, <span class="person" id="MC">Marc Bolan</span>, and bands like <span class="person" id="KISS">Kiss</span>, began to draw inspiration from sci-fi as they ramped up their showmanship 
by adding sci-fi “backstories” to their performances, resulting in the birth of Glam Rock.</p>

<p>So, it should come as no surprise that many underground shops began to carry items that fit the Glam Rock aesthetic, although, many 
people loved the <span class="keyword" id="music">music</span> but didn't buy into the glam rock <span class="keyword" id="fashion">fashion</span> movement. As a result, many consider glam rock to be one of the first 
actual pop subcultures out there.</p>
<br> <h2 class="title-2">1980'S GOTH </h2><br>

<p>One of the most eminent spinoffs of glam rock was goth <span class="keyword" id="music">music</span>. Originally, goth <span class="keyword" id="music">music</span> started off as death rock, which is just about as 
dark and gloomy as one would expect it to be. Death rock progressed into synthpop, new wave, and several other similar genres.</p>

<p>Most of these sullen <span class="keyword" id="music">music</span>genres became tied to quite a few other habits, such as wearing all black, a love of  horror movies, pale 
make-up, dark burgundy lipstick, and just enjoying the darker side of life. Gothic <span class="keyword" id="fashion">fashion</span>'s beginnings often mimicked the spookier 
elements with 'witch-like' <span class="keyword" id="fashion">fashion</span>, much like many of <span class="person" id="TB">Tim Burton</span>'s characters.</p>
<br> <h2 class="title-2">1990'S GRUNGE </h2><br>

<p>In the nineties, a new sound was born out of teenage angst, known as Grunge <span class="keyword" id="music">music</span>. These young, garage band musicians rebelled against 
their very commercialized way that life of living in suburbia, and the anger they had against the world. Artists like <span class="person" id="KC">Kurt Cobain</span> ended 
up venting it via <span class="keyword" id="music">music</span>…and it resonated with a whole generation of teens.</p>

<p>The gritty, unkept look of those style clothing quickly attracted those who liked the <span class="keyword" id="music">music</span>'s edgy appeal. <span class="person" id="MJ">Marc Jacobs</span> was an early 
adopter of this look. Today, the 90s grunge movement still remains a identifiable <span class="keyword" id="fashion">fashion</span> trend.</p>
<br><h2 class="title-2"> 1990'S HIP-HOP </h2><br>
<img src="img/img articolo 1 gaia/TLCs-Tionne-T-Boz-Watkins-Lisa-Left-Eye-Lopes-and-Rozonda-Chilli-Thomas-owned-the-90s-as-the-best-selling-American-girl-group-of-all-time.-Photo-Creit-Getty-Images-768x1152.jpg">

<p>By the late eighties and early nineties, hip-hop exploded and became one of the most popular forms of <span class="keyword" id="music">music</span>. Hip-hop culture was born on 
the streets of urban neighborhoods like <span class="place" id="NYC">New York</span>, <span class="place" id="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</span>, and <span class="place" id="Detroit">Detroit</span>, where rap battles, breakdancing, and turntablism became a 
way of life for teens.</p>

<p>It was just a matter of time that the influence of hip hop began to spread outside of urban areas and embraced by teens all across 
America. People began to emulate the <span class="keyword" id="fashion">fashion</span> of rappers, and by the time that hip hop became mainstream, it became synonymous with a 
specific style of clothing. Some of the most popular hip hop trends were baggy pants with your underwear logo peaking through, Adidas 
tracksuits, oversized sports jerseys, bucket hats, bold colors, and plenty of gold chain necklaces.</p>
<br> <h2 class="title-2">2010'S EDM: ELECTRIC DANCE MUSIC</h2> <br>

<p>During the nineties, the underground world of electronica boomed, as warehouses hosted Radical Audio-Visual Experiences, which would 
eventually be known as raves. These parties were about promoting Peace, Love, Unity, and Respect through heavy beats, turntable matches, 
and of course, heavy drug usage.</p>

<p>This underground Electric Dance <span class="keyword" id="music">Music</span> (EDM) movement never really left but in the early 2000's the rave culture had a resurgence that 
morphed to include tiny bikinis, glowing wings, UFO pants, and of course, leg fuzzies.</p>
