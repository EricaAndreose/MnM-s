			<h2 class="title-2">1. Introduction <a class="noteRef" href="#n01">1</a></h2>
			<p>The duration of the meNet project was from 10/2006 to 09/2009. Information can be found
			on the platform created especially for this purpose, www.menet.info. The meNet project
			groups worked on specific aspects of <span class="keyword" id="musicEducation">music education</span>, as the following diagram shows:
			<br>
			<img src="img/img_chiara3/art3img1.png" alt="Diagram showing the specific aspects of music education on which the meNet project groups worked on " width="300" height="200">
			<br>
			The project was a partnership involving 26 active partner institutions from 20 European
			countries including <span class="place" id="AT">Austria</span>, <span class="place" id="BE">Belgium</span>, <span class="place" id="HR">Croatia</span>, <span class="place" id="CZ">Czech Republic</span>,
			<span class="place" id="EE">Estonia</span>, <span class="place" id="FI">Finland</span>, <span class="place" id="FR">France</span>,
			<span class="place" id="DE">Germany</span>, <span class="place" id="EL">Greece</span>, <span class="place" id="HU">Hungary</span>, <span class="place" id="IT">Italy</span>, <span class="place" id="ME">Montenegro</span>,
			<span class="place" id="NL">Netherlands</span>, <span class="place" id="NO">Norway</span>, <span class="place" id="PL">Poland</span>,
			<span class="place" id="SK">Slovakia</span>, <span class="place" id="SI">Slovenia</span>, <span class="place" id="ES">Spain</span>, <span class="place" id="SE">Sweden</span>, and the <span class="place" id="UK">United Kingdom</span>. In addition, 70 associated partner
			institutions cooperated in the project in different ways.</p>

			<p>One of the main aims of the project was investigating teaching and learning music at primary
			and secondary general <span class="keyword" id="school">schools</span> and music <span class="keyword" id="teacherTraining">teacher training</span> in order to (a) make
			understandable and transparent the various theoretical and practical approaches to music
			education in <span class="place" id="EU">Europe</span>, (b) improve and increase the quality of <span class="keyword" id="musicEducation">music education</span> as part of
			<span class="keyword" id="school">school</span> curricula and (c) propose changes to <span class="keyword" id="school">school</span> curricula and the content of training
			courses for music teachers.</p>

			<h2 class="title-2">2. Methodology</h2>
			<p>he current research design is located within the social-critical paradigm, whilst a qualitative
			methodology was used, supported by some quantitative elements, to analyse the data. The
			method of data collection involved collecting information on <span class="keyword" id="musicEducation">music education</span> in schools in
			20 different <span class="place" id="EU">EU</span> countries in order to gain insight into specific issues related to each country.
			For the data analysis, various official documents were also interpreted as a result of
			discussions with the project partners. Different graphs and tables were created to illustrate
			the bigger picture emerging from the data that led towards comparisons and
			generalisations. A variety of examples in context were mentioned within the project, of
			which two specific ones will be mentioned, supported by data derived from interviews with participant teachers and pupils. To increase the validity of the data presented, many
			revisions of project data were made by the project and associated partners. In addition,
			external help was sought in order to collect accurate information from non-project countries
			i.e. <span class="place" id="FR">France</span>, <span class="place" id="IT">Italy</span>, <span class="place" id="HU">Hungary</span> etc. As a result of the themes that emerged from the data
			analysis, the current presentation will try to highlight three main issues: (a) the current
			situation of <span class="keyword" id="musicEducation">music education</span> across <span class="place" id="EU">Europe</span>, (b) examples of practice in context and (c)
			suggestions and guidelines for <span class="keyword" id="musicEducation">music education</span>.</p>

			<h2 class="title-2">3. The current situation of <span class="keyword" id="musicEducation">music education</span> across <span class="place" id="EU">Europe</span></h2>
			<p>As a result of the <span class="place" id="Maastricht">Maastricht</span> Treaty in 1992, new norms were imposed on all <span class="place" id="EU">EU</span> states in the
			field of education and cultural politics <a class="noteRef" href="#n02">2</a>, which were nevertheless adopted in the
			intergovernmental agreements. Consequently there are many differences in the way
			different educational and cultural policies are put into practice in various countries (Obuljen,
			2004). For that reason it makes sense to carry out comparative studies of the current
			situation of <span class="keyword" id="musicEducation">music education</span> in the different countries across the <span class="place" id="EU">EU</span>. Kertz-Welzel (2008)
			stresses the necessity of focusing on comparative <span class="keyword" id="musicEducation">music education</span> in the 21st century, as
			scholars and music teachers in many countries are struggling with similar problems such as
			<span class="keyword" id="teacherTraining">teacher training</span>, performance-based or general <span class="keyword" id="musicEducation">music education</span>, classroom management or
			standards in <span class="keyword" id="musicEducation">music education</span>. Τhe exchange between various traditions of <span class="keyword" id="musicEducation">music education</span>
			can help in terms of developing more effective methods in comparative <span class="keyword" id="musicEducation">music education</span> and
			in <span class="keyword" id="musicEducation">music education</span> programmes for teachers. However, Kertz-Welzel (2004) stresses that the
			problem with most comparative <span class="keyword" id="musicEducation">music education</span> research is that it usually tries to
			encompass a complete system without paying much attention to particular aspects.
			Comparative <span class="keyword" id="musicEducation">music education</span> is concerned with the description and comparison of different
			systems of <span class="keyword" id="musicEducation">music education</span> at national and regional level. The nature of studies in
			comparative <span class="keyword" id="musicEducation">music education</span> can vary although single-system or comparative studies are
			most commonly used for describing the system of <span class="keyword" id="musicEducation">music education</span>, its aims and curriculum
			(Kemp & Lepherd, 1992). This kind of comparative studies in <span class="keyword" id="musicEducation">music education</span> seems to be
			relevant to the needs of all music teachers because today’s music classrooms are in a sense
			always multicultural beyond national boundaries, following some authors (Barth, 2000;
			Stroh, 2000) who argue that the teacher and the pupils always have different backgrounds
			(e.g. classical / hip-hop) irrespective of children’s nationalities.</p>
			
			<p>The meNet project suggests that comparative <span class="keyword" id="musicEducation">music education</span> issues can give music
			teachers a deeper understanding of music didactics in particular and of pedagogy in general.
			Besides, as some researchers underline (Schlegel, 2001; Rodríguez-Quiles, 2001; Dogani,
			2004) <span class="keyword" id="musicEducation">music education</span> in each European country has some diversity in relation to the way it
			is put into practice based on contextual and cultural factors. We will begin by presenting the
			forms of <span class="keyword" id="school">school</span> organisation in 20 European countries.</p>

			<h2 class="title-3">3.1. <span class="keyword" id="school">School</span> organisation</h2>
			<p>Prior to understanding the way <span class="keyword" id="musicEducation">music education</span> is structured in the countries surveyed, a
			consideration of the organisation of <span class="keyword" id="school">schools</span> was considered crucial within the project. A
			comparison of <span class="keyword" id="school">school</span> structures in our 20 countries shows that there are differences in what
			is considered to be “primary” and “secondary” education. There is variety in the starting age
			for compulsory schooling. The following chart clarifies this:
			<br>
			<img src="img/img_chiara3/art3img2.png" alt="Chart showing differences in what is considered 'primary' and 'secondary' education in 20 European countries" width="300" height="200">
			<br>
			Graph 1. <span class="keyword" id="school">School</span> structures in 20 European countries
			On the basis of the above chart, specific comments can be made for kindergarten, primary
			and secondary levels.</p>

			<p><u>Kindergarten.</u> In most of the 20 countries, kindergarten is optional. From the analysis, it
			appears that in those countries music does not have a clear role to play in the curriculum as
			it is not prescribed clearly for this age range and is dependent on the teacher’s musical skills
			and abilities. In Spanish kindergartens, for example, music does not appear to be a separate
			subject, and the time children spend on music is not stipulated in the official documents.
			Only in six countries is kindergarten compulsory at three different starting ages, namely at
			age 4-5 in the <span class="place" id="UK">UK</span>, 5-6 in the <span class="place" id="CZ">Czech Republic</span>, <span class="place" id="EL">Greece</span>, <span class="place" id="HU">Hungary</span>, and <span class="place" id="SK">Slovakia</span>, and 6-7 in
			<span class="place" id="PL">Poland</span>. In contrast to the situation of music in the previous countries, these countries
			exhibit a clearer framework for music. For example, in the <span class="place" id="UK">UK</span> and <span class="place" id="EL">Greece</span>, there is a clear
			framework for music with tentative recommendations for specific music activities in the
			curriculum, comprising the basic music activities of performing, composing, evaluating,
			listening, and applying knowledge, as the following chart shows:</p>

			<p><u>Primary education.</u> Although in the majority of the countries (14 countries), <span class="keyword" id="school">school</span> starts at
			age 6, the age of finishing primary <span class="keyword" id="school">school</span> varies (in eight countries it is 12). The following
			chart also shows big differences between four of the project countries with respect to the
			character of schooling, the content of the curriculum, and the status of music. Although in all
			four countries primary education is compulsory, there are some in which there is flexibility in the school’s implementation of the curriculum, i.e., <span class="place" id="DE">Germany</span> and <span class="place" id="ES">Spain</span>. Within the
			curriculum, children have specific music tuition from music teachers with special music
			<span class="keyword" id="teacherTraining">teacher training</span>. Participation in a choir is compulsory only in <span class="place" id="SI">Slovenia</span>, following the
			country’s long choral tradition. In <span class="place" id="DE">Germany</span> and <span class="place" id="EL">Greece</span>, it is optional, but appears to be a

			<p>Looking at the above table, it can be said that in general, <span class="keyword" id="school">schools</span> and individual teachers have
			autonomy as to what and how to teach music. However, there are big differences in the
			autonomy and organisation of the curriculum between <span class="place" id="SI">Slovenia</span> (centralised) and <span class="place" id="DE">Germany</span>,
			<span class="place" id="EL">Greece</span>, and <span class="place" id="ES">Spain</span> (decentralised). Although music in secondary <span class="keyword" id="school">schools</span> is organised around
			specific musical activities such as (a) listening and understanding music, (b) performing, and (c) composing, in practice a more holistic approach to <span class="keyword" id="musicEducation">music education</span> is usually adopted.
			This is made evident by the fact that music is often seen as a vehicle for developing wider
			cultural understanding by engaging in music from around the globe. In many countries, this is
			also seen as an important vehicle for preserving or establishing a national identity, and
			learners are often exposed to traditional folk culture music and dance. This is particularly
			prevalent in eastern European countries (<span class="place" id="EE">Estonia</span>, <span class="place" id="EL">Greece</span>, <span class="place" id="PL">Poland</span>, <span class="place" id="SK">Slovakia</span>, <span class="place" id="SI">Slovenia</span>, etc.).</p>

			<p>An important question relates to the way the differences in the starting ages are affecting
			<span class="keyword" id="musicEducation">music education</span> and consequently music <span class="keyword" id="teacherTraining">teacher training</span>. First of all, it can be said that due
			to these differences in <span class="keyword" id="school">school</span> ages, there is no common developmental ground for all
			European children and teenagers. In addition to this, as the age increases, there is greater
			concentration on other subjects than music, i.e., in <span class="place" id="EL">Greece</span> music is not taught at all in the
			final years of secondary <span class="keyword" id="school">school</span> (ages 15 - 18). In <span class="place" id="ES">Spain</span>, although at the moment there is
			music <span class="keyword" id="teacherTraining">teacher training</span> at universities for primary <span class="keyword" id="school">schools</span>, not every <span class="keyword" id="school">school</span> can have a well-
			trained music teacher because many members of the <span class="keyword" id="school">school</span> staff do not regard it as strictly
			necessary. Music is still seen as a subordinate subject at <span class="keyword" id="school">school</span>. However, although the
			situation was almost the same in countries like <span class="place" id="EL">Greece</span>, things have changed lately, and
			there is increased recruitment of music teachers at primary and secondary Hellenic <span class="keyword" id="school">schools</span>.
			On the other hand, in some countries in the south of Europe like <span class="place" id="FR">France</span>, <span class="place" id="EL">Greece</span>, <span class="place" id="IT">Italy</span>, or
			<span class="place" id="ES">Spain</span>, although there is usually a music teacher in the secondary <span class="keyword" id="school">school</span>, the lack of special
			music <span class="keyword" id="teacherTraining">teacher training</span> might be problematic since these teachers, who only hold a degree
			in musicology which is mainly based on the history of Western music, are asked to teach in
			general <span class="keyword" id="school">schools</span>. These serious discrepancies between <span class="keyword" id="musicEducation">music education</span> and music teacher
			training as well as the huge differences between the countries in southern <span class="place" id="EU">Europe</span>, central <span class="place" id="EU">Europe</span>, and
			northern <span class="place" id="EU">Europe</span>, need to change urgently within the European Higher Education Area
			(EHEA) and as a result of the Declaration of <span class="place" id="Bologna">Bologna</span> of the year 1999.</p>
			
			<h2 class="title-3">3.2. Importance of music in <span class="keyword" id="school">schools</span></h2>
			<p>In all 20 countries surveyed, the study of music in <span class="keyword" id="school">schools</span> is seen as a valued and important
			component of compulsory schooling as demonstrated through education policies and
			expressed in national curricula. However, in some cases there is a contradiction between
			the “written curriculum” and the “curriculum in praxis”. The latter can be the result of a
			combination of curriculum guidelines and the teacher’s theoretical framework and
			educational philosophy in relation to the teaching of music (Dogani, 2004). This is the case
			in <span class="place" id="ES">Spain</span>, for instance (Rodríguez-Quiles, 2001). For that reason it is argued that studies on
			<span class="keyword" id="musicEducation">music education</span> only based on official documents can only cover a part of the educational
			reality <a class="noteRef" href="#n06">6</a>. Due to the existence of this contradiction it can be a difficult and sensitive matter to
			collect such information. Although the current research tried to present a picture of music
			education in the different European countries based not only on official documents but on
			individuals’ knowledge and experience each country’s situation, more research in this field is
			needed to cover the situation across <span class="place" id="EU">Europe</span>, especially using in-depth qualitative methods
			such as case studies, discussion groups, interviews and so on (Denzin & Lincoln, 2000;
			Patton, 2002). In addition, it would be important to involve all those who influence the
			process of teaching and learning music, that is politicians, heads of <span class="keyword" id="school">schools</span>, music teachers,
			non-music teachers, pupils, parents but also music managers, music editors, journalists, etc.</p>

			<p>The analysis of the data collected indicated that in the countries included there is a common
			belief that music is an important subject in the curriculum as it develops specific musical
			skills (performing, composing, listening and understanding), personal skills (creativity, self-
			identity and self-esteem, communication skills) and cultural awareness (global and national
			identity, cohesive community). However, the question needs to be asked why, despite this
			common understanding, those involved in education - even politicians! - adopt contradictory
			and weak policies for general <span class="keyword" id="school">school</span> music in many countries, especially in the south of
			<span class="place" id="EU">Europe</span>. However, <span class="place" id="EE">Estonia</span> might currently represent a happy exception to this rule. One of
			the main strategies for developing Estonian society consists of two components: good
			education and singing, including choral singing. For that reason, one of the main goals of
			music teaching within the general education system is to preserve and maintain class="place" id="EE">Estonia
			cultural heritage and traditions. The case of <span class="place" id="SI">Slovenia</span> can also be of interest as music has a
			very good balance within the general curriculum and there is a close relationship between
			the national cultural context and music <span class="keyword" id="teacherTraining">teacher training</span>.</p>

			<p>With reference to the content of the music lessons, it is sometimes adapted to the context
			of the beliefs and traditions of a specific country. The example of <span class="place" id="EE">Estonia</span> might highlight
			this point, as this tiny Baltic state is often described as a “singing nation”. Many would say
			that their singing tradition led to the bloodless establishment of the country’s independence
			in 1991 through the so-called “singing revolution”. Preserving national identity is often seen
			as a main goal within a <span class="keyword" id="musicEducation">music education</span> system. In <span class="place" id="SK">Slovakia</span> and <span class="place" id="HU">Hungary</span> for instance,
			students are expected to be able to dance eastern European folk dances such as the polka
			and czardas. In <span class="place" id="SI">Slovenia</span>, great importance is attached to traditional music. In <span class="place" id="EL">Greece</span>,
			traditional singing and dancing are also part of general <span class="keyword" id="musicEducation">music education</span> and are usually very
			much in evidence at <span class="keyword" id="school">school</span> celebrations of national festivals. However, this is not the case
			for <span class="keyword" id="musicEducation">music education</span> in <span class="place" id="ES">Spain</span>, despite the rich folklore with which the country is usually
			associated. This paper will, within its own constraints, try to highlight the latter using
			specific examples of practice in context for <span class="place" id="SI">Slovenia</span> and <span class="place" id="ES">Spain</span>.</p>

			<p>Another point worthy of attention is the place of ensemble music making in <span class="keyword" id="school">schools</span>. The
			current research underlined the need for further research in this area. However, it can be
			said that although all countries recognise the importance of being a member of a choir or an
			instrumental ensemble for one’s personal and musical development, the practical
			implementation of this is left largely to chance. Access to instrumental tuition is variable
			across <span class="place" id="EU">Europe</span> and is sometimes left completely outside the responsibility of the <span class="keyword" id="school">school</span>
			system, thereby influencing the way <span class="keyword" id="musicEducation">music education</span> is put into practice. In <span class="place" id="BE">Belgium</span> for
			example, young people are not offered the chance to learn to play an instrument in <span class="keyword" id="school">schools</span>
			but these opportunities are available in special music <span class="keyword" id="school">schools</span> which run in the evenings and
			at the weekends. In <span class="place" id="SI">Slovenia</span>, each <span class="keyword" id="school">school</span> must have at least a choir and often a string
			orchestra. In <span class="place" id="EL">Greece</span> and in <span class="place" id="ES">Spain</span>, a choir might be organised as a result of a teacher’s
			disposition to do so and it is rather rare to have instrumental ensembles in general <span class="keyword" id="school">schools</span>.
			The reasons for and constraints resulting from this great variability among the different
			countries examined in relation to ensemble music making need to be explored further.</p>

			<h2 class="title-3">3.3. Time allocation for <span class="keyword" id="musicEducation">music education</span></h2>
			<p>There are often national guidelines for the amount of curriculum time allocated to music but
			it is mostly the case that individual <span class="keyword" id="school">school</span> managers have a good deal of autonomy when it
			comes to deciding how much time is actually allocated to <span class="keyword" id="musicEducation">music education</span>. The following
			diagram provides an overview of time allocation for <span class="keyword" id="musicEducation">music education</span> in <span class="place" id="EU">Europe</span>:
			<br>
			<img src="img/img_chiara3/art3img3.png" alt="Time allocation for music education at schools" caption="Time allocation for music education at schools" width="300" height="200">
			<figcaption>Table 5: Time allocation for <span class="keyword" id="musicEducation">music education</span> at <span class="keyword" id="school">schools</span></figcaption>
			<br>
			In the above table it can be seen that in the majority of the countries music takes place for
			• 1 hour per week at kindergarten and primary level with a maximum of 2-3 hours in
			certain countries and
			• 1 to 4 and 5 hours per week in the secondary <span class="keyword" id="school">schools</span>
			Indeed there are some countries in which the time devoted to music is not necessarily
			compulsory or can be supplemented by additional optional time depending on the resources
			of the individual <span class="keyword" id="school">school</span> and the importance attached to <span class="keyword" id="musicEducation">music education</span> by the <span class="keyword" id="school">school</span>
			managers.

			<figcaption>Table 6: Optional time for <span class="keyword" id="musicEducation">music education</span> at <span class="keyword" id="school">schools</span></figcaption>
			<br>
			It is evident that there are big differences as to what primary and secondary <span class="keyword" id="school">school</span> might
			mean which has a lot of implications for the way <span class="keyword" id="musicEducation">music education</span> is put into practice in the
			different countries. Two interesting facts emerge from the analysis: (a) almost all countries
			share the same amount of music lessons per week in primary <span class="keyword" id="school">school</span> but (b) there are big
			differences in secondary <span class="keyword" id="school">school</span>.</p>

			<h2 class="title-2">4. Examples of Practice in Context</h2>
			<p>Within meNet, specific examples of practice were chosen to demonstrate
			<ol type="a">
				<li> the diversity and richness of actual practice in <span class="keyword" id="school">schools</span> across <span class="place" id="EU">Europe</span></li>
				<li> the way different aspects of music learning are emphasised</li>
				<li> characteristic and sustainable practice</li>
				<li> innovative practice</li>
			</ol>
			These examples are simply cases related to specific contexts. Thus, they are not intended to
			be generalised. It is up to the reader him or herself to make appropriate use (or not) of their
			“unfamiliarity” with the following information in order to work with it in a different way.
			This is precisely the point of qualitative research. For the purposes of the current paper, two
			specific examples of practice in context will be mentioned in order to demonstrate the
			different opportunities offered for promoting cultural diversity in two different <span class="keyword" id="school">school</span>
			settings.</p>

			<p>Example 1 - <span class="place" id="SI">Slovenia</span>: “Integrating <span class="keyword" id="folkMusic">folk music</span> into the primary music curriculum” <a class="noteRef" href="#n07">7</a>
			<br>
			<i>Main purpose:</i> to develop pupils’ sensibility and positive attitude towards their national
			musical heritage and their cultural identity.
			<br>
			Example 2 - <span class="place" id="ES">Spain</span>: “Beyond the sound: socialising through music at school” <a class="noteRef" href="#n08">8</a>
			<br>
			<i>Main purpose:</i> to help pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds to socialise through music at school</p>	

			<h2 class="title-3">4.1. Example 1 - <span class="place" id="SI">Slovenia</span>: “Integrating <span class="keyword" id="folkMusic">folk music</span> into the primary music curriculum”</h2>
			<p><u>Introduction.</u> The first example of music teaching in a primary <span class="keyword" id="school">school</span> in <span class="place" id="SI">Slovenia</span> is a typical
			example of practice that focuses on an integrated approach in which Slovenian <span class="keyword" id="folkMusic">folk music</span> is
			presented to the children in a manner that is close to their current experiences. The
			ultimate aim is to develop pupils’ sensibility and positive attitude towards their national
			musical heritage and cultural identity. Given the emphasis within the Slovenian curriculum
			on Slovenian <span class="keyword" id="folkMusic">folk music</span>, the role of the teacher role in this transmission process is crucial.
			However, the latter can be problematic due to teachers’ unfamiliarity with the folk material
			of dance and music as a result of insufficient inclusion of <span class="keyword" id="folkMusic">folk music</span> in <span class="keyword" id="teacherTraining">teacher training</span> or in-
			service <span class="keyword" id="teacherTraining">teacher training</span> programmes as well as the current trend towards globalisation. For
			that reason, encouraging new ideas and methods for approaching <span class="keyword" id="folkMusic">folk music</span> in Slovenian
			teaching practice appears to be crucial in reconnecting teachers and children with their folk
			roots. By means of an intercultural approach the example also promotes opportunities for
			cultural diversity.</p>

			<p><u>The example.</u> The example presents an effective approach of active learning through the
			interaction of listening, creative movement and dance activities. The content is a musical
			fairytale titled “The Shepherd and the Bewitched Princess” based on <span class="keyword" id="folkMusic">folk music</span> from
			different regions of <span class="place" id="SI">Slovenia</span> (<span class="place" id="Pomurje">Pomurje</span>, <span class="place" id="Štajerska">Štajerska</span>) and from <span class="place" id="Rezija">Rezija</span> (Slovenian ethnic minority
			in north-eastern <span class="place" id="IT">Italy</span>). In their creative responses to the music, children spontaneously used
			some elements from Slovenian folk dances, such as twirling and stepping, or adapted
			Slovenian folk dances. They internalised musical language and expressed it through
			spontaneous movements. The example was developed gradually in music lessons over the
			course of four weeks with children attending the 3rd class of primary <span class="keyword" id="school">school</span> (aged 8).
			Within the musical aims of the lesson, the children were to improve not only their ability to
			listen attentively to Slovenian <span class="keyword" id="folkMusic">folk music</span> pieces but also to develop their expressive
			responses to the character of the music and the musical elements through creative 15
			movement and dance. In addition, specific aims related to psychomotor and affective areas
			were to develop the children’s spatial awareness, coordination, communication skills,
			interpersonal relationships and independent learning. The lesson included specific steps
			that would lead to the final performance. After listening to the fairytale and Slovenian folk
			music, the children expressed some parts of the story through creative movement and
			dance figures, while creating common movements through group work for another part of
			the story. The groups presented their work and reflected on it based on the following
			questions: “How were you feeling? What were you satisfied with? What additional
			suggestions do you have? What changes would be needed?” etc. As a result of the
			evaluation process they made suggestions for improvement which were included in their
			presentations and they ultimately connected all the parts of the story in common group
			presentations. They staged the fairytale along with musical accompaniment and narration
			by the teacher. The class performances were followed by public presentations to the pupils’
			parents, some neighbouring primary <span class="keyword" id="school">schools</span> and at the Faculty of Education, University of
			<span class="place" id="Ljubljana">Ljubljana</span>.</p>

			<p><u>Impact of the lesson on the participants.</u> Specific comments from the pupils and the teachers
			as well as the parents will be presented to gain insight into the impact of the specific lesson
			and the performance on them. After the performance, pupils expressed the great interest
			and joy they derived from moving and dancing to <span class="keyword" id="folkMusic">folk music</span> that now seemed familiar to
			them, as “I heard on the radio the same music I was dancing to as the witch”. After the
			performance, the teachers commented that they noticed pupils’ enjoyment and found it an
			“interesting combination of tradition and the present day that really attracts pupils! Most
			importantly, all children participated and felt the structure of Slovenian <span class="keyword" id="folkMusic">folk music</span> and
			danced to it as if they had known it forever”. In addition, in student teachers’ reflections
			after seeing the performance it is evident that they considered “the combination of fairytale
			and dance an excellent starting point for interdisciplinary connections”. They also
			commented that “from a pedagogical point of view, <span class="keyword" id="folkMusic">folk music</span> is much closer to the child
			and more appreciated; so much interesting and diverse music!” Finally, the parents were
			also moved by the performance: “I was moved; it was as though I was looking at myself at
			that young age.” More importantly, it seemed that they started appreciating <span class="keyword" id="folkMusic">folk music</span>
			themselves. They admitted that “old <span class="keyword" id="folkMusic">folk music</span> is so simple and so rich... Children get
			familiar with <span class="keyword" id="folkMusic">folk music</span>; in our house we almost never listen to it.”</p>

			<p><u>Key outcomes.</u> By looking at the whole picture emerging from this lesson, specific key
			outcomes can be mentioned. These are that the pupils:
			<ul>
				<li> appreciated and listened attentively to <span class="keyword" id="folkMusic">folk music</span>; used <span class="keyword" id="folkMusic">folk music</span> to distinguish
				specific musical elements in it, such as tempo (faster from slower), dynamics (louder
				from softer), structure (repetition and contrast);</li>
				<li> explored, chose and organised movement ideas; used movement skills and
				orientation in space; expressed the musical elements through creative movement,
				developing their coordination;</li>
				<li> developed their personal skills such as their self-esteem, self-confidence,
				attentiveness, independent learning, interpersonal relationships and
				communication.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>

			<h2 class="title-3">4.2. Example 2 - <span class="place" id="ES">Spain</span>: “Beyond the sound: socialising through music at school”</h2>
			<p><u>Introduction:</u> The second example presents the work done at a particular secondary <span class="keyword" id="school">school</span>
			in <span class="place" id="ES">Spain</span> in which music is used in a multidisciplinary way and as part of the compulsory
			curriculum, to motivate students from disadvantaged backgrounds in both educational and
			social dimensions <a class="noteRef" href="#n09">9</a>. The data was collected during the year 2008, a time at which the project
			had already being running for a decade.</p>
		

			
			<p>The students are 12-16 years old and they belong to different ethnic minorities of which 20-
			35% are gypsies. There is a wide ability range among the students and at the same time
			specific problems are mentioned related to <span class="keyword" id="school">school</span> absenteeism (20%), family breakdowns,
			aggressive behaviour, low attainment levels at entry to secondary <span class="keyword" id="school">school</span> and a high dropout
			rate (14%). The impetus for the project was the interest of a group of teachers to find an
			approach that, by focusing on diversity, would enable them to integrate students from
			difficult environments and motivate them both socially and educationally by working in
			music and the arts. The project aimed to increase not only their self-confidence to learn but
			also their appreciation of the possibilities that the <span class="keyword" id="school">school</span> can offer them. Thus, the focus
			was not only on learning music but also on acquiring social skills such as respecting rules,
			respecting and listening to each other, working cooperatively, expressing emotions. In
			addition, learning to comply with time limits seemed to be an important life skill to be
			acquired, especially for gypsy students. A characteristic of gypsy people that the teachers
			were well aware of is that they perceive the passage of time differently from non-gypsy
			people. This has implications on the way they perceive not only music but their whole life. Based on such inside knowledge of their groups of students, the teachers organised the
			whole range of activities to help them in all areas of their development.</p>
			
			<p><u>The example.</u> This example is an innovative and unique practice in the Spanish context that
			supports and promotes inclusion, opportunities for reflective practice in evaluation and
			assessment and opportunities to innovate and become critical. Most of the teachers at this
			<span class="keyword" id="school">school</span> have adopted a multidisciplinary approach to learning in which subjects that are
			considered to foster students’ socialisation such as music, arts and sport are taken as a
			reference point for a lot of activities that are included as a normal part of their curriculum.
			This is evident in the following comment made by one of the teachers at the <span class="keyword" id="school">school</span>:
			<center><i>“The most important thing the teachers in this <span class="keyword" id="school">school</span> have learnt is that
			music is a very special subject and the music teacher can make it really
			special; so special that precisely the most difficult pupils are the most
			integrated in the musical activities.”</i>(French teacher, 11/02/08).</center>
			In summary, the four main aims of the <span class="keyword" id="school">school</span> plan are:
			<ul>
				<li> teachers use music as a methodological approach for educating sensibility, self-
				control and the values of peace and non-violence in difficult social contexts;</li>
				<li> students learn to use different sources of information (musical, historical, graphical,
				journalistic) for their own musical and artistic creation;</li>
				<li> students are encouraged to participate in musical activities both individually and in
				groups, with an open, interested and respectful attitude;
				<li> teamwork is promoted not only among students but also among teachers through
				cooperating interdepartmentally on multidisciplinary ways of working</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			
			<p>The whole project is based on practical music lessons (i.e. singing, playing instruments,
			dancing) in which <span class="person" id="EW">Edgard Willems</span>’ method is used to teach solmisation, vocal and aural
			training. Regular workshops are organised in cooperation with the art teacher (i.e. painting
			in response to musical composition, making hand puppets for a musical show or making
			costumes for an opera) and the participation of other teachers and parents. It is important
			to stress that
			<center><i>“all the teachers in this <span class="keyword" id="school">school</span> bend over backwards to help the music and
			the art teachers, because we see how they manage to transform things;
			they have transformed the <span class="keyword" id="school">school</span> and the pupils thanks to a project that
			gave attention to diversity […] We have all understood that music is
			something that all people carry inside them and it has to be taken out.”</i>
			(French teacher, 11/02/08).</center>
			Invited musicians are also interacting with pupils whilst there is cooperation with the city
			orchestra <a class="noteRef" href="#n10">10</a>. Optional participation in a choir is also offered including a wide repertoire
			including pop songs and songs from other cultures. Student participation in complementary
			activities inside and outside <span class="keyword" id="school">school</span> is also encouraged, i.e. going to concerts, visiting
			exhibitions, meeting musicians. Throughout the activities the focus is not only on musical
			skills but also on important values such as cultivating peace and non-violence, cooperation,
			solidarity and sexual identity.</p>
			
			<p>It appears that the <span class="keyword" id="school">school</span> adopts a flexible approach to the use of space, time, groupings
			and the deployment of the teaching staff <a class="noteRef" href="#n11">11</a>. The whole <span class="keyword" id="school">school</span> atmosphere aims to stimulate
			children’s aesthetic sensitivity; posters and background music related to current musical
			events and issues is constantly present in the whole building (e.g. <span class="person" id="WAM">Mozart</span>’s anniversary,
			<span class="person" id="LP">Pavarotti</span>’s death). This influences the teaching staff in a positive way:
			<center><i>“The thing that impressed me the most the first time I came to this <span class="keyword" id="school">school</span> for
			teaching practice was the music playing in the corridors and that fact gripped
			me. I was quite sure that I wanted to work in this centre as a teacher later
			on.” </i>(Technology teacher, 11/02/08).</center> The constant sound of music seems to have a specific impact on the students as well, since
			they point out that <i>“here in this <span class="keyword" id="school">school</span> music is playing all the time, from our arrival until we
			leave […]. This helps us feel much better” </i>(Interview with a 10th grade student, 18/03/08).</p>
			
			<p><u>Key outcomes.</u> The project presented has a positive impact on various parts of the
			community. Not only the teaching staff supported the project and worked actively for this
			model of education, but also the whole community accepted music as an important subject.
			The students have shown the benefits of their participation in the project as there has been
			a decrease in the numbers and severity of different conflict situations and a decrease in
			student failure rates from 60% to 16%. Absenteeism has dropped from 18% to 14% and the
			dropout rate has fallen slightly. In general, students display a more positive attitude and
			greater sensitivity towards listening not only to music but also to other people. This was
			affirmed by the art teacher who noticed that <i>“it is evident that pupils love what they listen to
			here in the <span class="keyword" id="school">school</span> […]. Some of them have even changed their behaviour thanks to their
			participation in the choir […] because music has entered their lives in a way it didn’t do
			before.”</i></p>
			
			<p>As a result of participation in the project, other curricular development projects are
			proposed in the <span class="keyword" id="school">school</span> relating to music and focusing on diversity through music and on
			developing emotional education at secondary <span class="keyword" id="school">school</span> to improve coexistence through
			cooperative work. The <span class="keyword" id="school">school</span> has also won many awards at local and national level.</p>
		
			<p>Most of all, the positive personal experience of the students is the biggest success of the
			project. The following comment by a 10th grade student to her music teacher sums it up:
			<center><i>“What you have achieved is amazing! After my experience with you... I thank
			you for all the music you have made me listen to; you have made me read,
			you have made me sing… Because you, with your heart, with your soul always
			full of sounds, have made this <span class="keyword" id="school">school</span> a place for music, a different place
			located in this village of the great poet García-Lorca, a village of poetry… and
			music. Thank you very much for making us feel and live all that. Many little
			kisses, Eva.”</i></center>
			Trying to implement this project in other similar <span class="keyword" id="school">schools</span> is the key challenge facing the
			<span class="keyword" id="school">school</span>, as well is cooperating closely with the music <span class="keyword" id="teacherTraining">teacher training</span> courses at the
			University of <span class="place" id="Granada">Granada</span> in order to make future music teachers aware of this work.</p>

			<h2 class="title-3">4.3. Comparing the two examples</h2>
			<p>
			<ul>
				<li> A common problem was raised in both countries: teachers often neglect <span class="keyword" id="folkMusic">folk music</span>
				because they are not familiar enough with the richness of this music and dances and
				do not have enough knowledge to teach them. This is also due to the fact that folk
				music is not given adequate emphasis either in University <span class="keyword" id="teacherTraining">teacher training</span>
				programmes or in programmes of in-service <span class="keyword" id="teacherTraining">teacher training</span>.</li>
				<li> An important difference between the two countries: the Slovenian curriculum clearly
				stipulates the integration of local and national music in everyday practice. The
				Spanish curriculum is much more open: although the curriculum suggests what can
				be included or excluded in it, it is up to each particular <span class="keyword" id="school">school</span> to decide what to do
				or what not to do. It is remarkable that in the Spanish <span class="keyword" id="school">school</span> (of this particular
				example) it was understood that it was very important also to pay attention to the
				music pupils consider as their “own” music (flamenco, hip-hop…) without simply
				considering the “music of the teacher” (that is, western classical music) as the only
				important music.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>

			<p>Outcomes emerging from pupils’ involvement in both cases:</p>
			<p>Pupils
			<ul>
				<li>displayed a more positive attitude and greater sensitivity towards listening (not only
				to music but also to other people)</li>
				<li>expressed great interest in and derived great enjoyment from movement and
				dancing</li>
				<li>appreciated and used music</li>
				<li>developed their self-esteem, self-confidence, attentiveness, independent learning,
				interpersonal relationships, communication skills</li>
				<li>gradual awareness of cultural diversity in a global world
				Common musical aims</li>
				<li>attentive listening to (folk) music pieces, expressive responses to the character of
				music and the musical elements through creative movement, practical class music
				lessons including singing, playing instruments, dancing</li>
				Common aspects
				<li>using music as a methodological approach to educate sensibility, self-control and the
				values of peace and non-violence.</li>
				<li>participation in musical activities both individually and in groups with an open,
				interested and respectful attitude.</li>
				<li>promoting teamwork among pupils in order to benefit from cooperative work based
				on the values of collaboration and solidarity</li>
				<li>independent learning</li>
			</ul>
			</p>

			<p>It is really interesting that both cases offer good possibilities for
			<ul>
				<li> building close cooperation with other <span class="keyword" id="school">schools</span> which are in a similar situation
				<li> dissemination into everyday teaching practice through programmes of in-service</li>
				<span class="keyword" id="teacherTraining">teacher training</span></li>
				<li> dissemination into other cultural contexts by means of a multicultural approach</li>
			</ul> 
			</p>

			<p>Following these two examples, we see that it is necessary and useful to be able to interlink
			<span class="keyword" id="musicEducation">music education</span> in the different systems and to rethink what music in present democratic
			societies should mean for children’s holistic education, as all European countries without
			exception assert, at least in a theoretical way. More than that, these examples show that it
			is possible to develop common understanding beyond geographical borders and it need not
			necessarily be difficult to agree on basic common principles for <span class="keyword" id="musicEducation">music education</span> in the
			framework of the European Union.</p>

			<h2 class="title-2">5. Some general conclusions</h2>
			<p>The difficulty of collecting information based on the parallel existence of a “written
			curriculum” and a “curriculum in praxis” demonstrates how important it is to collect this
			information. However, the current project has only scratched the surface. More in-depth
			work is needed based on each country’s information about <span class="keyword" id="musicEducation">music education</span>. Despite this
			some important facts can be noted as a result of the current research.</p>

			<p>Although music is separated into specific musical activities comprising listening to and
			understanding music, performing and creating music through composing and improvising, in
			practice a more holistic approach to <span class="keyword" id="musicEducation">music education</span> is usually adopted. This approach is
			often seen as a vehicle for developing wider cultural understanding through engagement
			with music from around the globe, but in many countries is also seen as an important vehicle
			for preserving a national identity and learners are often exposed to the traditional folk
			culture (music and dance) of that country. This is particularly prevalent in eastern European
			countries, like <span class="place" id="EL">Greece</span>, <span class="place" id="SI">Slovenia</span>, <span class="place" id="EE">Estonia</span>, etc.</p>

			<p>Despite this, <span class="keyword" id="musicEducation">music education</span> is usually considered an approximation to students’ learning
			interests because it focuses mainly on knowledge and skills instruction as a result of
			curriculum guidelines but does not reflect the students’ own interests and experiences.
			Oelkers and Larcher Klee (2006) stress that teaching has no guaranteed benefit for children
			since “peripheral” factors may be more influential than the learning opportunities offered at
			<span class="keyword" id="school">school</span>, especially in the case of music that is “omnipresent”. This fact usually implies a
			sequence of difficulties, of struggles, through the years of schooling that bear little
			relationship to pupils’ lived experiences. The music curriculum does not usually manage to
			equip pupils with suitable tools that would help them deal successfully with musical
			experiences. In this sense, Stenhouse’s approach to education, which sees teachers as
			researchers in classrooms, can offer a different perspective for improving curricula. He
			argued that curriculum research and development should belong to the teacher (Stenhouse,
			1975; Cochran-Smith & Lytle, 1999).</p>

			<p>In the case of the current project it can be said that an appropriate music <span class="keyword" id="teacherTraining">teacher training</span> is
			needed that can facilitate a climate that makes pupils’ legitimate expression possible as part
			of the search for their personal identities. Within that, students would need to learn to be
			open, flexible and receptive. That training would then need to put emphasis and high value
			on the place of music in young persons’ lives and contexts. The emphasis put on learning
			outcomes within the current European Higher Education Area can be problematic for the
			fields of music or arts, which are far removed from a technocratic conception of life. An
			education system led by “official knowledge” (Apple, 1993) and defined by extrinsic criteria
			separates learning from experience and devalues teachers’ improvisation skills, creating the
			illusion that all things in a classroom are predictable, thus following a technical approach to
			the curriculum.</p>

			<p>It is important for future development to realise that policies such as the Declaration of
			<span class="place" id="Bologna">Bologna</span> have been implemented in very different ways in various countries. In the case of
			<span class="keyword" id="musicEducation">music education</span> these differences will be huge across <span class="place" id="EU">Europe</span> and will have a serious impact
			on <span class="keyword" id="school">schools</span>. It appears that <span class="place" id="Bologna">Bologna</span> itself will not be able to solve the problems that music
			education has been dragging out for years, especially in the countries in southern <span class="place" id="EU">Europe</span>.
			The goal of <span class="keyword" id="musicEducation">music education</span> in <span class="keyword" id="school">schools</span> is not to make musicians in a strict sense but to
			contribute to the construction of identities which is possible thanks to the indisputable
			power of music to release emotions. Power, yes – but in some cases an unpredictable one.
			Rather than emphasising the programme as the context within which one can understand
			people’s lives and measure the significance of their actions, Kushner (2000) stresses the
			importance of combining democratic and participatory evaluation approaches for exploring
			the complexities of individual and group experience.</p>

			<p>That is also the case for the example of practice in context at the <span class="keyword" id="school">school</span> in <span class="place" id="ES">Spain</span>. Being
			aware of young people’s different views of the world, the teachers at the <span class="keyword" id="school">school</span> tried to
			avoid forcing their students to follow <span class="keyword" id="school">school</span> experiences that were alien to their immediate
			context. Thus, a “spiral curriculum” is open to other alternatives when necessary, whilst the
			common approach to the content areas from simple to complex can sometimes be
			subverted. A good example of that principle can be seen in the way that the opera <i>The
			Magic Flute</i> has been used as a holistic piece of knowledge in which the Spanish pupils
			became familiar with its different elements by working from general to particular, in a
			context where opera seems to be extremely strange. An important contribution of this
			<span class="keyword" id="school">school</span> to its students is that it has managed to connect different types of music with
			students’ lives and to familiarise them with complex musical experiences. Music was not
			seen as an isolated subject within the <span class="keyword" id="school">school</span> programme but as an area that can work well
			with the agreement of the whole teaching staff. In this sense, goals and standards emerge
			from situated understanding and create a safe environment in which students can freely
			express their views and feelings.</p>

			<p>The two examples of practice in context mentioned here show that beyond geographic
			borders it is possible to develop common understanding and to agree on basic common
			principles for <span class="keyword" id="musicEducation">music education</span> in the framework of the European Union. Nevertheless, the
			relationship between <span class="keyword" id="musicEducation">music education</span> and music <span class="keyword" id="teacherTraining">teacher training</span> is not ideal in some
			countries, especially in the countries of the southwestern of <span class="place" id="EU">Europe</span> (that is, <span class="place" id="FR">France</span>, <span class="place" id="EL">Greece</span>,
			<span class="place" id="IT">Italy</span>, <span class="place" id="ES">Spain</span>). In order to solve the contradictions that a technical approach to a music
			curriculum entails, it is necessary to introduce at universities and academies of music a more
			creative and socio-critical approach to the way future music teachers should be trained in
			<span class="place" id="EU">Europe</span>. Students should be able to understand the music classroom as a venue for
			interacting and confronting struggles in order to become unique personalities.</p>

			<p>It is therefore necessary to interlink <span class="keyword" id="musicEducation">music education</span> in the different systems and to rethink
			what music in the present democratic societies should mean for children’s integral
			education, not just in theoretical but in practical ways as well. Learning from each other’s
			experiences can only strengthen the place of <span class="keyword" id="musicEducation">music education</span> within the European Union for
			the benefit of all citizens.</p>
