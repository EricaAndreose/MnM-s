  			<p><span class="myFirstletter">M</span>obile technologies, along with the huge progress in audio signal processing, have given us <span class="keyword" id="algorithm">algorithm</span> developers the ability to create music recognizers.

            <h2 class="title-2">Analog to Digital - Sampling a Signal</h2>
  			
  			<p><span class="myFirstletter">R</span>eaders searching for <span class="keyword" id="shazam">Shazam</span> AI and <span class="keyword" id="shazam">Shazam</span> machine learning may be surprised to find that the <span class="keyword" id="shazam">Shazam</span> <span class="keyword" id="algorithm">algorithm</span> involves neither of these technologies, even if they did exist in various forms back then. If <span class="keyword" id="shazam">Shazam</span> isn’t AI <span class="keyword" id="MusicRecognition">music recognition</span>, what exactly is its approach?</p>

            <p>To answer that, we first have to ask: What is sound, really? Is it some sort of mystical material that we cannot touch but which flies into our ears and makes us hear things?</p>

            <p>Of course, this is not quite the case. We know that in reality, sound is a vibration that propagates as a mechanical wave of pressure and displacement, through a medium such as air or water. When that vibration comes to our ears, particularly the eardrum, it moves small bones which transmit the vibration further to little hair cells deep in our inner ear. Finally, the little hair cells produce electrical impulses, which are transmitted to our brain through the auditory ear nerve.</p>

            <p><span class="myFirstletter">R</span>ecording devices mimic this process fairly closely, using the pressure of the sound wave to convert it into an electrical signal. An actual sound wave in air is a continuous pressure signal. In a microphone, the first electrical component to encounter this signal translates it into an analog voltage signal - again, continuous. This continuous signal is not so useful in the digital world, so before it can be processed, it must be translated into a discrete signal that can be stored digitally. This is done by capturing a digital value that represents the amplitude of the signal.</p>

            <p><span class="myFirstletter">T</span>he conversion involves quantization of the input, and it necessarily introduces a small amount of error. Therefore, instead of a single conversion, an analog-to-digital converter performs many conversions on very small pieces of the signal - a process known as sampling.</p>

                <img src="img/img_shazam/01.png">
            </figure>

            <p><span class="myFirstletter">T</span>he Nyquist-Shannon Theorem tells us what sampling rate is necessary to capture a certain frequency in continuous signal. In particular, to capture all of the frequencies that a human can hear in an audio signal, we must must sample the signal at a frequency twice that of the human hearing range. The human ear can detect frequencies roughly between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz. As a result, audio is most often recorded at a sampling rate of 44,100 Hz. This is the sampling rate of Compact Discs, and is also the most commonly used rate with MPEG-1 audio (VCD, SVCD, MP3). (This specific rate was originally chosen by Sony because it could be recorded on modified video equipment running at either 25 frames per second (PAL) or 30 frames per second (using an NTSC monochrome video recorder) and cover the 20,000 Hz bandwidth thought necessary to match professional analog recording equipment of the time.) So, when choosing the frequency of the sample that is needed to be recorded you will probably want to go with 44,100 Hz.</p>

            <h2 class="title-2">Recording - Capturing the Sound</h2>

            <p>Let’s get into some <span class="keyword" id="shazam">Shazam</span> code.</p>

            <p><span class="myFirstletter">R</span>ecording a sampled audio signal is easy. Since modern sound cards already come with analog-to-digital converters, just pick a programming language, find an appropriate library, set the frequency of the sample, number of channels (typically mono or stereo), sample size (e.g. 16-bit samples). Then open the line from your sound card just like any input stream, and write to a byte array. Here is how that can be done in <span class="keyword" id="java">Java</span>:</p>

            <!-- inser code snippet -->

            <pre>
                <code class="language-java">
                        private AudioFormat getFormat() {
                        float sampleRate = 44100;
                        int sampleSizeInBits = 16;
                        int channels = 1;          //mono
                        boolean signed = true;     //Indicates whether the data is signed or unsigned
                        boolean bigEndian = true;  //Indicates whether the audio data is stored in big-endian or little-endian order
                        return new AudioFormat(sampleRate, sampleSizeInBits, channels, signed, bigEndian);
                    }
                    
                    final AudioFormat format = getFormat(); //Fill AudioFormat with the settings
                    DataLine.Info info = new DataLine.Info(TargetDataLine.class, format);
                    final TargetDataLine line = (TargetDataLine) AudioSystem.getLine(info);
                    line.open(format);
                    line.start();
                </code>
            </pre>
            

            <p><span class="myFirstletter">J</span>ust read the data from TargetDataLine. (In this example, the running flag is a global variable which is stopped by another thread - for example, if we have GUI with the STOP button.)</p>

            <pre>
                <code class="language-java">
                    OutputStream out = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
                    running = true;
                    
                    try {
                        while (running) {
                            int count = line.read(buffer, 0, buffer.length);
                            if (count &gt; 0) {
                                out.write(buffer, 0, count);
                            }
                        }
                        out.close();
                    } catch (IOException e) {
                        System.err.println(&quot;I/O problems: &quot; + e);
                        System.exit(-1);
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>

            <h2 class="title-2">Time-Domain and Frequency-Domain</h2>

            <p><span class="myFirstletter">W</span>hat we have in this byte array is signal recorded in the time domain. The time-domain signal represents the amplitude change of the signal over time.</p>

            <p>In the early 1800s, <span class="person" id="JBJF">Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier</span> made the remarkable discovery that any signal in the time domain is equivalent to the sum of some (possibly infinite) number of simple sinusoidal signals, given that each component sinusoid has a certain frequency, amplitude, and phase. The series of sinusoids that together form the original time-domain signal is known as its Fourier series.</p>

            <p>In other words, it is possible to represent any time domain signal by simply giving the set of frequencies, amplitudes, and phases corresponding to each sinusoid that makes up the signal. This representation of the signal is known as the frequency domain. In some ways, the frequency domain acts as a type of fingerprint or signature for the time-domain signal, providing a static representation of a dynamic signal.</p>

            <p><span class="myFirstletter">T</span>he following animation demonstrates the Fourier series of a 1 Hz square wave, and how an (approximate) square wave can be generated out of sinusoidal components. The signal is shown in the time domain above, and the frequency domain below.</p>

            <img src="img/img_shazam/toptal-blog-image-1422868988200.gif">

            <p><span class="myFirstletter">A</span>nalyzing a signal in the frequency domain simplifies many things immensely. It is more convenient in the world of digital signal processing because the engineer can study the spectrum (the representation of the signal in the frequency domain) and determine which frequencies are present, and which are missing. After that, one can do filtering, increase or decrease some frequencies, or just recognize the exact tone from the given frequencies.</p>

            <div id="decor3"></div>

            <h2 class="title-2">The Discrete Fourier Transform</h2>

            <p><span class="myFirstletter">S</span>o we need to find a way to convert our signal from the time domain to the frequency domain. Here we call on the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) for help. The DFT is a mathematical methodology for performing Fourier analysis on a discrete (sampled) signal. It converts a finite list of equally spaced samples of a function into the list of coefficients of a finite combination of complex sinusoids, ordered by their frequencies, by considering if those sinusoids had been sampled at the same rate.</p>

            <p>One of the most popular numerical <span class="keyword" id="algorithm">algorithm</span>s for the calculation of DFT is the Fast Fourier transform (FFT). By far the most commonly used variation of FFT is the Cooley–Tukey <span class="keyword" id="algorithm">algorithm</span>. This is a divide-and-conquer <span class="keyword" id="algorithm">algorithm</span> that recursively divides a DFT into many smaller DFTs. Whereas evaluating a DFT directly requires O(n2) operations, with a Cooley-Tukey FFT the same result is computed in O(n log n) operations.</p>

            <p>It’s not hard to find an appropriate library for FFT. Here are few of them:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>C – FFTW</li>
                <li>C++ – EigenFFT</li>
                <li>Java – JTransform</li>
                <li>Python – NumPy</li>
                <li>Ruby – Ruby-FFTW3 (Interface to FFTW)</p></li>
            </ul>

            <p>Below is an example of an FFT function written in <span class="keyword" id="java">Java</span>. (FFT takes complex numbers as input. To understand the relationship between complex numbers and trigonometric functions, read about Euler’s formula.)</p>

            <!-- insert code snippet-->

            <pre>
                <code class="language-java">
                    public static Complex[] fft(Complex[] x) {
                    int N = x.length;
                    
                    // fft of even terms
                    Complex[] even = new Complex[N / 2];
                    for (int k = 0; k &lt; N / 2; k++) {
                        even[k] = x[2 * k];
                    }
                    Complex[] q = fft(even);
                
                    // fft of odd terms
                    Complex[] odd = even; // reuse the array
                    for (int k = 0; k &lt; N / 2; k++) {
                        odd[k] = x[2 * k + 1];
                    }
                    Complex[] r = fft(odd);
                
                    // combine
                    Complex[] y = new Complex[N];
                    for (int k = 0; k &lt; N / 2; k++) {
                        double kth = -2 * k * Math.PI / N;
                        Complex wk = new Complex(Math.cos(kth), Math.sin(kth));
                        y[k] = q[k].plus(wk.times(r[k]));
                        y[k + N / 2] = q[k].minus(wk.times(r[k]));
                    }
                    return y;
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>And here is an example of a signal before and after FFT analysis:</p>

            <!-- insert image-->

            <h2 class="title-2">Music Recognition: Fingerprinting a Song</h2>

            <p><span class="myFirstletter">O</span>ne unfortunate side effect of FFT is that we lose a great deal of information about timing. (Although theoretically this can be avoided, the performance overheads are enormous.) For a three-minute <span class="keyword" id="song">song</span>, we see all the frequencies and their magnitudes, but we don’t have a clue when in the <span class="keyword" id="song">song</span> they appeared. But this is the key information that makes the <span class="keyword" id="song">song</span> what it is! Somehow we need to at know what point of time each frequency appeared.</p>

            <p>That’s why we introduce kind of sliding window, or chunk of data, and transform just this part of the information. The size of each chunk can be determined in a few different ways. For example, if we record the sound, in stereo, with 16-bit samples, at 44,100 Hz, one second of such sound will be 44,100 samples * 2 bytes * 2 channels ≈ 176 kB. If we pick 4 kB for the size of a chunk, we will have 44 chunks of data to analyze in every second of the <span class="keyword" id="song">song</span>. That’s good enough density for the detailed analysis needed for audio identification.</p>

            <p>Now back to programming:</p>

            <!-- insert code snippet-->

            <pre>
                <code class="language-java">
                    byte audio [] = out.toByteArray()
                    int totalSize = audio.length
                    int sampledChunkSize = totalSize/chunkSize;
                    Complex[][] result = ComplexMatrix[sampledChunkSize][];
                    
                    for(int j = 0;i &lt; sampledChunkSize; j++) {
                    Complex[chunkSize] complexArray;
                    
                    for(int i = 0; i &lt; chunkSize; i++) {
                        complexArray[i] = Complex(audio[(j*chunkSize)+i], 0);
                    }
                    
                    result[j] = FFT.fft(complexArray);
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p><span class="myFirstletter">I</span>n the inner loop we are putting the time-domain data (the samples) into a complex number with imaginary part 0. In the outer loop, we iterate through all the chunks and perform FFT analysis on each.</p>

            <p>Once we have information about the frequency makeup of the signal, we can start forming our digital fingerprint of the <span class="keyword" id="song">song</span>. This is the most important part of the entire <span class="keyword" id="shazam">Shazam</span> audio recognition process. The main challenge here is how to distinguish, in the ocean of frequencies captured, which frequencies are the most important. Intuitively, we search for the frequencies with the highest magnitude (commonly called peaks).</p>

            <p><span class="myFirstletter">H</span>owever, in one <span class="keyword" id="song">song</span> the range of strong frequencies might vary between low C - C1 (32.70 Hz) and high C - C8 (4,186.01 Hz). This is a huge interval to cover. So instead of analyzing the entire frequency range at once, we can choose several smaller intervals, chosen based on the common frequencies of important musical components, and analyze each separately. For example, we might use the intervals this guy chose for his implementation of the <span class="keyword" id="shazam">Shazam</span> <span class="keyword" id="algorithm">algorithm</span>. These are 30 Hz - 40 Hz, 40 Hz - 80 Hz and 80 Hz - 120 Hz for the low tones (covering bass guitar, for example), and 120 Hz - 180 Hz and 180 Hz - 300 Hz for the middle and higher tones (covering vocals and most other instruments).</p>

            <p>Now within each interval, we can simply identify the frequency with the highest magnitude. This information forms a signature for this chunk of the <span class="keyword" id="song">song</span>, and this signature becomes part of the fingerprint of the <span class="keyword" id="song">song</span> as a whole.</p>

            <p><span class="myFirstletter">N</span>ote that we must assume that the recording is not done in perfect conditions (i.e., a “deaf room”), and as a result we must include a fuzz factor. Fuzz factor analysis should be taken seriously, and in a real system, the program should have an option to set this parameter based on the conditions of the recording.</p>

            <p><span class="myFirstletter">I</span>f we run a whole library of songs through this music identification process, we can build up a database with a complete fingerprint of every <span class="keyword" id="song">song</span> in the library.</p>

            <h2 class="title-2">The Music <span class="keyword" id="algorithm">algorithm</span>: Song Identification</h2>

            <p><span class="myFirstletter">T</span>o identify a <span class="keyword" id="song">song</span> that is currently playing in the club, we record the <span class="keyword" id="song">song</span> with our phone, and run the recording through the same audio fingerprinting process as above. Then we can start searching the database for matching hash tags.</p>

            <p><span class="myFirstletter">A</span>s it happens, many of the hash tags will correspond to the music identifier of multiple <span class="keyword" id="song">song</span>s. For example, it may be that some piece of <span class="keyword" id="song">song</span> A sounds exactly like some piece of <span class="keyword" id="song">song</span> E. Of course, this is not surprising - musicians have always “borrowed” licks and riffs from each other, and these days producers sample other songs all the time. Each time we match a hash tag, the number of possible matches gets smaller, but it is likely that this information alone will not narrow the match down to a single <span class="keyword" id="song">song</span>. So there is one more thing that we need to check with our <span class="keyword" id="MusicRecognition">music recognition</span> <span class="keyword" id="algorithm">algorithm</span>, and that is the timing.</p>

            <p><span class="myFirstletter">T</span>he sample we recorded in the club might be from any point in the <span class="keyword" id="song">song</span>, so we cannot simply match the timestamp of the matched hash with the timestamp of our sample. However, with multiple matched hashes, we can analyze the relative timing of the matches, and therefore increase our certainty.</p>

            <p>For example, if you look in the table above, you will see that hash tag 30 51 99 121 195 corresponds to both Song A and Song E. If, one second later, we match the hash 34 57 95 111 200, that’s one more match for Song A but in this case we know that both the hashes and time differences matches.</p>

            <p>Let’s take i1 and i2 as moments in the recorded <span class="keyword" id="song">song</span>, and j 1  and j 2  as moments in the <span class="keyword" id="song">song</span> from database. We can say that we have two matches with time difference match if three things are all true:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>RecordedHash(i1) = SongInDBHash(j1)</li>
                <li>RecordedHash(i2) = SongInDBHash(j2)</li>
                <li>abs(i1-i2) = abs(j1-j2)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This gives us flexibility to record the <span class="keyword" id="song">song</span> from the beginning, middle, or end.</p>

            <p><span class="myFirstletter">F</span>inally, it is unlikely that every single moment of the <span class="keyword" id="song">song</span> we record in the club will match every corresponding moment of the same <span class="keyword" id="song">song</span> in our library, recorded in the studio. The recording will include a lot of noise that will introduce some error in the matches. So instead of of trying to eliminate all but the correct <span class="keyword" id="song">song</span> from our list of matches, at the very end, we sort all the matched songs in descending order of likelihood, and our favorite is the first <span class="keyword" id="song">song</span> on the ranking list.</p>

            <h2 class="title-2">From Top to Bottom</h3>

            <p>To answer the question, “How does <span class="keyword" id="shazam">Shazam</span> work?” here’s an overview of the entire <span class="keyword" id="MusicRecognition">music recognition</span> and matching process, from top to bottom:</p>

            <p>For this kind of system, the database can get pretty huge, so it is important to use some kind of scalable database. There is no special need for relations, and the data model ends up being pretty simple, so it is a good case for using some kind of NoSQL database.</p>

            <h2 class="title-2">How Does Shazam Work? Now You Know</h2>

            <p><span class="myFirstletter">T</span>his kind of <span class="keyword" id="song">song</span> recognition software can be used for finding the similarities between songs. Now that you understand how <span class="keyword" id="shazam">Shazam</span> works, you can see how this can have applications beyond simply Shazaming that nostalgic <span class="keyword" id="song">song</span> playing on the taxi radio. For example, it can help to identify plagiarism in music, or to find out who was the initial inspiration to some pioneers of blues, jazz, rock, pop or any other genre. Maybe a good experiment would be to fill up the <span class="keyword" id="song">song</span> sample database with the classical music of <span class="person" id="Bach">Bach</span>, <span class="person" id="Beethoven">Beethoven</span>, <span class="person" id="Vivaldi">Vivaldi</span>, <span class="person" id="Wagner">Wagner</span>, <span class="person" id="Chopin">Chopin</span> and <span class="person" id="Mozart">Mozart</span> and try finding the similarities between songs. You would think that even <span class="person" id="BD">Bob Dylan</span>, <span class="person" id="EP">Elvis Presley</span> and <span class="person" id="RJ">Robert Johnson</span> were plagiarists!</p>

            <p>But still we cannot convict them, because music is just a wave that we hear, memorize and repeat in our heads, where it evolves and changes until we record it in the studio and pass it on to the next great musical genius.</p>
